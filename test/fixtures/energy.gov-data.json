      "description": "According to the Energy Information Administration (EIA) of the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), geothermal energy generation in the United States is projected to more than triple by 2040 (EIA 2013). This addition, which translates to more than 5 GW of generation capacity, is anticipated because of technological advances and an increase in available sources through the continued development of enhanced geothermal systems (EGSs) and low-temperature resources (EIA 2013). Studies have shown that air emissions, water consumption, and land use for geothermal electricity generation have less of an impact than traditional fossil fuel–based electricity generation; however, the long-term sustainability of geothermal power plants can be affected by insufficient replacement of aboveground or belowground operational fluid losses resulting from normal operations (Schroeder et al. 2014). Thus, access to water is therefore critical for increased deployment of EGS technologies and, therefore, growth of the geothermal sector. This paper examines water issues relating to EGS development from a variety of perspectives. It starts by exploring the relationship between EGS site geology, stimulation protocols, and below ground water loss, which is one of the largest drivers of water consumption for EGS projects.  It then examines the relative costs of different potential traditional and alternative water sources for EGS. Finally it summarizes specific state policies relevant to the use of alternative water sources for EGS, and finally explores the relationship between EGS site geology, stimulation protocols, and below ground water loss, which is one of the largest drivers of water consumption for EGS projects.

      "description": "WEC-Sim (Wave Energy Converter Simulator) is an open-source wave energy converter (WEC) simulation tool. \r\n\r\nThe code is developed in MATLAB/SIMULINK using the multi-body dynamics solver SimMechanics. WEC-Sim has the ability to model devices that are comprised of rigid bodies, power-take-off systems, and mooring systems. Simulations are performed in the time-domain by solving the governing WEC equations of motion in 6 degrees-of-freedom as described in the WEC-Sim Theory Manual. The WEC-Sim project is funded by the U.S. Department of Energy’s Wind and Water Power Technologies Office and the code development effort is a collaboration between the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) and Sandia National Laboratories (SNL). \r\n\r\nMore information, including tutorials, avaialble at: http://en.openei.org/wiki/WEC-Sim",

      "description": "_Abstract:_  Monthly and annual average solar resource potential for the lower 48 states of the United States of America.\r\n\r\n_Purpose:_  Provide information on the solar resource potential for the for the lower 48 states of the United States of America.\r\n\r\n_Supplemental Information:_  This data provides monthly average and annual average daily total solar resource averaged over surface cells of approximatley 40 km by 40 km in size. This data was developed from the Climatological Solar Radiation (CSR) Model. The CSR model was developed by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory for the U.S. Department of Energy. Specific information about this model can be found in Maxwell, George and Wilcox (1998) and George and Maxwell (1999). This model uses information on cloud cover, atmostpheric water vapor and trace gases, and the amount of aerosols in the atmosphere to calculate the monthly average daily total insolation (sun and sky) falling on a horizontal surface. The cloud cover data used as input to the CSR model are an 7-year histogram (1985-1991) of monthly average cloud fraction provided for grid cells of approximately 40km x 40km in size. Thus, the spatial resolution of the CSR model output is defined by this database. The data are obtained from the National Climatic Data Center in Ashville, North Carolina, and were developed from the U.S. Air Force Real Time Nephanalysis (RTNEPH) program. Atmospheric water vapor, trace gases, and aerosols are derived from a variety of sources. The procedures for converting the collector at latitude tilt are described in Marion and Wilcox (1994). Where possible, existing ground measurement stations are used to validate the data. Nevertheless, there is uncertainty associated with the meterological input to the model, since some of the input parameters are not avalible at a 40km resolution. As a result, it is believed that the modeled values are accurate to approximately 10% of a true measured value within the grid cell. Due to terrain effects and other micoclimate influences, the local cloud cover can vary significantly even within a single grid cell. Furthermore, the uncertainty of the modeled estimates increase with distance from reliable measurement sources and with the complexity of the terrain.\r\n\r\nOther Citation Details:\r\nGeorge, R, and E.

      "description": "This dataset estimates the naturally available and technically recoverable U.S. wave energy resources, using a 51-month Wavewatch III hindcast database developed especially for this study by National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA's) National Centers for Environmental Prediction.  For total resource estimation, wave power density in terms of kilowatts per meter is aggregated across a unit diameter circle.  This approach is fully consistent with accepted global practice and includes the resource made available by the lateral transfer of wave energy along wave crests, which enables densities within a few kilometers of a linear array, even for fixed terminator devices.\r\n\r\n###Source###\r\nThe Wave Energy Resource Assessment project is a joint venture between [NREL](http://www.nrel.gov/), [EPRI](http://my.epri.com/portal/server.pt?), and [Virginia Tech](http://www.vt.edu/). EPRI is the prime contractor, Virginia Tech is responsible for development of the models and estimating the wave resource, and NREL serves as an independent validator and also develops the final GIS-based display of the data.\r\n\r\n###Geographic Range###\r\nUS coastline, including AK, HI and Puerto Rico, out to 50 nautical miles.\r\n\r\n###Grid Properties###\r\nGrids are derived from WaveWatch III grids. Near the coast of the lower 48 and HI, grids are squares, 4 minutes by 4 minutes (15 per degree).\r\nFor the Alaska grids AK and BS, the grid is 4 minutes of latitude by 8 minutes of longitude (15 per deg by 7.5 per deg).\r\n\r\n*Exception*: The area in the Bering Sea around the Pribilof (St Paul and St George) Islands is 10 min lat by 15 min lon. Limits: 55.666 to 58.000 N, -172.000 to - 168.000 E, 17 cols, 15 rows.\r\n\r\nFarther offshore, the grid is 10 min by 10 min. (only seen in WM and PR)\r\n\r\nThe 10 min by 10 min grid appears near the edge of a few grids: \r\n\r\n* SW corner of WM (off Mexican coast) \r\n* SE corner of WM (deep water) \r\n* PR - around edges (far from PR and US territory)\r\n\r\n###Bathymetric Impacts on Resource Assessment###\r\nBathymetric effects are known to have a large effect on wave characteristics at depths shallower than approximately 20m (~65 ft) on the Atlantic coast and 50 m (~160 ft) on the Pacific coast. A variance between depths exists due to the feature differences for each continental shelf.  The methodology used in this resource assessment precludes providing site-specific information to such developers. Reliable site-specific information in shallow waters can only be produced using results from models with higher spatial resolution that include shallow-water physics. The wave resource assessment group acknowledges that its results will not be accurate in the shallower waters of the inner continental shelf.  These shallow water regions are located within the dark gray boundaries on the map.\r\n\r\nData that are undefined or unrepresentable are indicated by NaN values in the CSV and as a -9999 value in the shapefile tables.\r\n\r\n### License Info\r\nPlease site Virginia Tech for data and modelling\r\nPlease site NREL for GIS files\r\n\r\nDISCLAIMER NOTICE\r\nThis GIS data was developed by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (\"NREL\"), which is operated by the Alliance for Sustainable Energy, LLC for the U.S. Department of Energy (\"DOE\").

      "description": "_(Abstract):_  Monthly Average Diffuse Solar Resource for Mexico, Central America, and the Caribbean Islands.\r\n\r\n_(Purpose):_  Provide information on the solar radiation for the data domain. The insolation values represent the average solar energy available at a shaded location.  This can be of value for day-lighting or other building applications.  The data can be combined with other data (global horizontal, direct normal) to estimate the global radiation on different surfaces.\r\n\r\n_(Supplemental Information):_   These data provide monthly average and annual average daily total solar resource averaged over surface cells of approximately 40 km by 40 km in size.  The solar resource value is represented as watt-hours per square meter per day for each month.  The data were developed from NREL's Climatological Solar Radiation (CSR) Model.  This model uses information on cloud cover, atmospheric water vapor and trace gases, and the amount of aerosols in the atmosphere to calculate the monthly average daily total insolation (sun and sky) falling on a horizontal surface.   Existing ground measurement stations are used to validate the data where possible.  The modeled values are accurate to approximately 10% of a true measured value within the grid cell due to the uncertainties associated with meteorological input to the model.  The local cloud cover can vary significantly even within a single grid cell as a result of terrain effects and other microclimate influences. Furthermore, the uncertainty of the modeled estimates increase with distance from reliable measurement sources and with the complexity of the terrain.\r\n\r\n### License Info\r\nRestrictions to acquisitions (Access Constraints):    This GIS data was developed by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (\"NREL\"), which is operated by the Midwest Research Institute for the U.S. Department of Energy (\"DOE\").

      "description": "_Abstract:_  Monthly and annual average solar resource potential for Alaska.\r\n\r\n_Purpose:_  Provide information on the solar resource potential for Alaska. The insolation values represent the average solar energy available to a flat plate collector, such as a photovoltaic panel, oriented due south at an angle from horizontal equal to the latitude of the collector location.\r\n\r\n_Supplemental Information:_  This data provides monthly average and annual average daily total solar resource averaged over surface cells of approximatley 40 km by 40 km in size. This data was developed from the Climatological Solar Radiation (CSR) Model. The CSR model was developed by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory for the U.S. Department of Energy. Specific information about this model can be found in Maxwell, George and Wilcox (1998) and George and Maxwell (1999). This model uses information on cloud cover, atmostpheric water vapor and trace gases, and the amount of aerosols in the atmosphere to calculate the monthly average daily total insolation (sun and sky) falling on a horizontal surface. The cloud cover data used as input to the CSR model are an 7-year histogram (1985-1991) of monthly average cloud fraction provided for grid cells of approximately 40km x 40km in size. Thus, the spatial resolution of the CSR model output is defined by this database. The data are obtained from the National Climatic Data Center in Ashville, North Carolina, and were developed from the U.S. Air Force Real Time Nephanalysis (RTNEPH) program. Atmospheric water vapor, trace gases, and aerosols are derived from a variety of sources. The procedures for converting the collector at latitude tilt are described in Marion and Wilcox (1994). Where possible, existing ground measurement stations are used to validate the data. Nevertheless, there is uncertainty associated with the meterological input to the model, since some of the input parameters are not avalible at a 40km resolution. As a result, it is believed that the modeled values are accurate to approximately 10% of a true measured value within the grid cell. Due to terrain effects and other micoclimate influences, the local cloud cover can vary significantly even within a single grid cell. Furthermore, the uncertainty of the modeled estimates increase with distance from reliable measurement sources and with the complexity of the terrain. Units are in watt hours.\r\n\r\nOther Citation Details:\r\n\r\nGeorge, R, and E.

      "description": "_Abstract:_  Monthly and annual average solar resource potential for Hawaii.\r\n\r\n_Purpose:_  Provide information on the solar resource potential for Hawaii. The insolation values represent the average solar energy available to a flat plate collector, such as a photovoltaic panel, oriented due south at an angle from horizontal equal to the latitude of the collector location.\r\n\r\n_Supplemental Information:_  This data provides monthly average and annual average daily total solar resource averaged over surface cells of approximatley 40 km by 40 km in size. This data was developed from the Climatological Solar Radiation (CSR) Model. The CSR model was developed by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory for the U.S. Department of Energy. Specific information about this model can be found in Maxwell, George and Wilcox (1998) and George and Maxwell (1999). This model uses information on cloud cover, atmostpheric water vapor and trace gases, and the amount of aerosols in the atmosphere to calculate the monthly average daily total insolation (sun and sky) falling on a horizontal surface. The cloud cover data used as input to the CSR model are an 7-year histogram (1985-1991) of monthly average cloud fraction provided for grid cells of approximately 40km x 40km in size. Thus, the spatial resolution of the CSR model output is defined by this database. The data are obtained from the National Climatic Data Center in Ashville, North Carolina, and were developed from the U.S. Air Force Real Time Nephanalysis (RTNEPH) program. Atmospheric water vapor, trace gases, and aerosols are derived from a variety of sources. The procedures for converting the collector at latitude tilt are described in Marion and Wilcox (1994). Where possible, existing ground measurement stations are used to validate the data. Nevertheless, there is uncertainty associated with the meterological input to the model, since some of the input parameters are not avalible at a 40km resolution. As a result, it is believed that the modeled values are accurate to approximately 10% of a true measured value within the grid cell. Due to terrain effects and other micoclimate influences, the local cloud cover can vary significantly even within a single grid cell. Furthermore, the uncertainty of the modeled estimates increase with distance from reliable measurement sources and with the complexity of the terrain. \r\nUnits are in watt hours.\r\n\r\nOther Citation Details:\r\n\r\nGeorge, R, and E.

      "description": "This data provides monthly average and annual average daily total solar resource averaged over surface cells of 0.1 degrees in both latitude and longitude, or about 10 km in size. This data was developed using the State University of New York/Albany satellite radiation model. This model was developed by Dr. Richard Perez and collaborators at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory and other universities for the U.S. Department of Energy. Specific information about this model can be found in Perez, et al. (2002). This model uses hourly radiance images from geostationary weather satellites, daily snow cover data, and monthly averages of atmospheric water vapor, trace gases, and the amount of aerosols in the atmosphere to calculate the hourly total insolation (sun and sky) falling on a horizontal surface. Atmospheric water vapor, trace gases, and aerosols are derived from a variety of sources. A modified Bird model is used to calculate clear sky direct normal (DNI). This is then adjusted as a function of the ratio of clear sky global horizontal (GHI) and the model predicted GHI. Where possible, existing ground measurement stations are used to validate the data. Nevertheless, there is uncertainty associated with the meteorological input to the model, since some of the input parameters are not available at a 10km resolution. As a result, it is believed that the modeled values are accurate to approximately 15% of a true measured value within the grid cell. Due to terrain effects and other microclimate influences, the local cloud cover can vary significantly even within a single grid cell. Furthermore, the uncertainty of the modeled estimates increase with distance from reliable measurement sources and with the complexity of the terrain.\r\n\r\n### License Info\r\nDISCLAIMER NOTICE\r\nThis GIS data was developed by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (\"NREL\"), which is operated by the Alliance for Sustainable Energy, LLC for the U.S. Department of Energy (\"DOE\").

      "description": "This data provides monthly average and annual average daily total solar resource averaged over surface cells of 0.1 degrees in both latitude and longitude, or about 10 km in size. This data was developed using the State University of New York/Albany satellite radiation model. This model was developed by Dr. Richard Perez and collaborators at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory and other universities for the U.S. Department of Energy. Specific information about this model can be found in Perez, et al. (2002). This model uses hourly radiance images from geostationary weather satellites, daily snow cover data, and monthly averages of atmospheric water vapor, trace gases, and the amount of aerosols in the atmosphere to calculate the hourly total insolation (sun and sky) falling on a horizontal surface. Atmospheric water vapor, trace gases, and aerosols are derived from a variety of sources. A modified Bird model is used to calculate clear sky direct normal (DNI). This is then adjusted as a function of the ratio of clear sky global horizontal (GHI) and the model predicted GHI. Where possible, existing ground measurement stations are used to validate the data. Nevertheless, there is uncertainty associated with the meteorological input to the model, since some of the input parameters are not available at a 10km resolution. As a result, it is believed that the modeled values are accurate to approximately 15% of a true measured value within the grid cell. Due to terrain effects and other microclimate influences, the local cloud cover can vary significantly even within a single grid cell. Furthermore, the uncertainty of the modeled estimates increase with distance from reliable measurement sources and with the complexity of the terrain.\r\n\r\nThis dataset uses geographic coordinate system GCS_North_American_1983\r\n\r\n### License Info\r\nThis GIS data was developed by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (\"NREL\"), which is operated by the Alliance for Sustainable Energy, LLC for the U.S. Department of Energy (\"DOE\").

      "description": "Estimate the potential for producing hydrogen from key renewable resources (onshore wind, solar photovoltaic, and biomass) by county for the United States. This study was conducted to estimate the potential for producing hydrogen from key renewable resources (onshore wind, solar photovoltaic, and biomass) by county in the United States and to create maps that allow the reader to easily visualize the results. To accomplish this objective, the authors analyzed renewable resource data both statistically and graphically utilizing a state-of-the-art Geographic Information System (GIS), a computer-based information system used to create and visualize geographic information.\r\n\r\nLand-use and environmental exclusions were applied to represent the most viable resources across the country. While wind, solar, and biomass are considered major renewable resources, other renewable energy resources could also be used for hydrogen production, thus contributing to hydrogen development locally and regionally. These additional resources include offshore wind, concentrating solar power, geothermal, hydropower, photoelectrochemical, and photobiological resources.\r\n\r\nThis study found that approximately 1 billion metric tons of hydrogen could be produced annually from wind, solar, and biomass resources in the United States. The greatest potential for producing hydrogen from these key renewable resources is in the Great Plains region. In addition, this research suggests that renewable hydrogen has the potential to displace gasoline consumption in most states if and when a number of technical and scientific barriers can be overcome.\r\n\r\n## License Info\r\nThis GIS data was developed by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (\"NREL\"), which is operated by the Alliance for Sustainable Energy, LLC for the U.S. Department of Energy (\"DOE\").

Existing ground measurement stations are used to validate the data where possible.  The modeled values are accurate to approximately 10% of a true measured value within the grid cell due to the uncertainties associated with meteorological input to \r\nthe model.  The local cloud cover can vary significantly even within a single grid cell as a result of terrain effects and other microclimate influences.

      "description": "Emissions from energy use in buildings\r\nare usually estimated on an annual basis using annual average multipliers.  Using annual numbers provides a reasonable\r\nestimation of emissions, but it provides no indication of the temporal nature\r\nof the emissions.  Therefore, there is no\r\nway of understanding the impact on emissions from load\r\nshifting and peak shaving technologies such as thermal energy storage, on-site\r\nrenewable energy, and demand control.  \r\n\r\nThis project utilized GridViewTM, an\r\nelectric grid dispatch software package, to estimate hourly emission\r\nfactors for all of the [eGRID](http://www.epa.gov/cleanenergy/energy-resources/egrid/) subregions in the continental United\r\nStates. These factors took into account electricity imports and exports\r\nacross the eGRID subregion boundary, and included estimated\r\ntransmission and distribution (T) losses.  Emission types accounted for included carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), and sulfur dioxide (SO2).Data\r\nreported as part of this project include hourly average, minimum, and\r\nmaximum emission factors by month; that is, the average, minimum, and\r\nmaximum emission factor for the same hour of each day in a month.\r\nPlease note that the data are reported in lbs/MWh, where the MWh value\r\nreported is site electricity use (the actual electricity used at the\r\nbuilding) and the pounds of emissions reported are the emissions\r\ncreated at the generator to meet the building load, including\r\ntransmission and distribution losses. The demand profiles used to\r\ngenerate the data pertain to the following years: eastern interconnect\r\n- 2005; Electricity Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) - 2008;\r\nWestern Electricity Coordinating Council (WECC) - 2008.",

      "description": "The Form EIA-860 is a generator-level \r\nsurvey that collects specific information about existing and planned \r\ngenerators and associated environmental equipment at electric power \r\nplants with 1 megawatt or greater of combined nameplate capacity. The \r\nsurvey data is summarized in reports such as the [Electric Power Annual](http://www.eia.doe.gov/cneaf/electricity/epa/epa_sum.html). The survey data is also available for download here.\r\n\r\n   The data are compressed into a \r\nself-extracting (.exe) zip folder containing .XLS data files and record \r\nlayouts. The current file structure (starting with 2009 data) consists \r\nof a record layout, 8 data files and a copy of the applicable version of\r\n the Form EIA-860 on which the data was collected.\r\n\r\nThe record layout provides a \r\ndirectory of all (published) data elements collected on the Form EIA-860\r\n together with the related description, specific file location(s), and, \r\nwhere appropriate, explanation of codes. The data files consist of the \r\nfollowing (substitute the applicable year for \"yy\" in the file name):\r\n   \r\n UtylityYyy - Contains respondent contact information and utility-level data for the surveyed generators.\r\n\r\nPlantYyy - Contains plant-level data for the surveyed generators.\r\n\r\nGeneratorYyy - Contains generator-level data for the surveyed generators, split into \r\nthree tabs. The \"Exist\" tab includes those generators which are \r\ncurrently operating, out of service or on standby; the \"Prop\" tab \r\nincludes those generators which are planned and not yet in operation; \r\nand the \"Ret_IP\" tab includes those generators which were cancelled \r\nprior to completion and operation and retired generators at existing \r\nplants (does not include data for retired generators at plants at which \r\nall generators have been retired).\r\n\r\nOwnerYyy - Contains data on the owner and/or operator of the surveyed generators.\r\n\r\nMultiFuelYyy - Contains data on fuel-switching and the use of multiple fuels by \r\nsurveyed generators, split into three tabs: \"Exist,\" \"Prop,\" and \r\n\"Ret_IP.\" See GeneratorsYyy above for a description of the tabs.\r\n\r\nInterconnectYyy - Contains interconnection data for the surveyed generators.\r\n\r\nEnviroAssocYyy - Contains boiler association data for the environmental equipment data \r\ncollected on the Form EIA-860. The \"Boiler_Gen\" identifies which boilers\r\n are associated with each generator; the \"Boiler_Cool\" tab shows which \r\ncooling systems are associated with each boiler; the \"Boiler_FGD\" tab \r\nshows which flue gas desulfurization (FGD) systems are associated with \r\neach boiler; the \"Boiler_FGP\" tab shows which flue gas particulate (FGP)\r\n collectors are associated with each boiler; and the \"Boiler_SF\" tab \r\nshows which stacks and flues are associated with each boiler.\r\n\r\nEnviroEquipYyy - Contains environmental equipment data for the surveyed generators. The \r\n\"Boiler\" tab collects boiler data as collected on Schedule 6, Parts B, \r\nand C of the Form EIA-860; \"Control\" tab contains emission data as \r\ncollected on Schedule 6, Parts D and E; the \"Cooling\" tab collects \r\ncooling system data as collected on Schedule 6, Part F; the \"FGD\" tab \r\ncollects FGD data as collected on Schedule 6, Part H; the \"FGP\" tab \r\ncollects FGP data as collected on Schedule 6, Part G; and the \r\n\"StackFlue\" tab collects stack and flue data as collected on Schedule 6,\r\n Part I.\r\n\r\n_Contact:_\r\n\r\nVlad Dorjets\r\n\r\nPhone: 202-586-3141\r\n\r\nE-Mail: [Vlad Dorjets](mailto:Vlad.Dorjets@eia.gov)",

Building summary includes details about: form, fabric, and HVAC. Zone summary includes details such as: area, volume, lighting, and occupants for all types of zones in the building. Location summary includes key building information as it pertains to each climate zone, including: fabric and HVAC details, utility costs, energy end use, and peak energy demand.\r\nIn total, DOE developed [16 reference building types](http://en.openei.org/wiki/Commercial_Reference_Buildings#Building_Types \"OpenEI Wiki Reference Building Types List\") that represent approximately 70% of commercial buildings in the U.S.; for each type, building models are available for three categories: new construction, post-1980 construction existing buildings, pre-1980 construction existing buildings. The commercial reference buildings (formerly known as commercial building benchmark models) were developed by the [U.S. Department of Energy (DOE)](http://en.openei.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Energy \"OpenEI Wiki page for DOE\"), in conjunction with three of its national laboratories.\r\nAdditional data is available directly from DOE's Energy Efficiency & Renewable Energy [(EERE) Website](http://www1.eere.energy.gov/buildings/commercial_initiative/reference_buildings.html), including EnergyPlus software input files (.idf) and results of the EnergyPlus simulations (.html).",

      "description": "This dataset corresponds to the final report on a screening study to compare six methods of removing noncondensable gases from direct-use geo-thermal steam power plants. This report defines the study methodologies and compares the performance and economics of selected gas-removal systems. Recommendations are presented for follow-up investigations and implementation of some of the technologies discussed. The specific gas-removal methods include five vacuum system configurations using the conventional approach of evacuating gas/vapor mixtures from the power plant condenser system and a system for physical separation of steam and gases upstream of the power turbine. The study focused on flashed-steam applications, but the results apply equally well to flashed-steam and dry-steam geothermal power plant configurations. Two gas-removal options appear to offer profitable economic potential. The hybrid vacuum system configurations and the reboiler process yield positive net present value results over wide-ranging gas concentrations. The hybrid options look favorable for both low-temperature and high-temperature resource applications. The reboiler looks profitable for low-temperature resource applications for gas levels above about 20,000 parts per million by volume. A vacuum system configuration using a three-stage turbocompressor battery may be profitable for low-temperature resources, but results show that the hybrid system is more profitable. The biphase eductor alternative cannot be recommended for commercialization at this time. \r\nThe report is available from NREL's publication database.",

The data source is the \r\nsurvey Form EIA-861, \"Annual Electric Power Industry Report.\" Data for \r\nall years are final.\r\n\r\nThe file F861yr09.exe is a file of data collected on\r\n the Form EIA-861, Annual Electric Power Industry Report, for the \r\nreporting period, calendar year 2009.   The zipped .exe file contains 11\r\n .xls files and one Word file, and a .pdf of the Form EIA-861.  The data\r\n file structure detailed here also applies to data files for prior \r\nyears.\r\n\r\n* File1 contains aggregate operational data such as control area operators (years prior to 2005), energy balance, and revenue information from each electric utility in the country, including power marketers, and Federal power marketing administrations.\r\n* File1_cao contains (2005 forward) data on control area operators.\r\n* File1_a (2007 forward) contains data on the types of activities each utility engages in, the NERC regions of operation, whether the utility generates power, and if it operates alternative-fueled vehicles.\r\n* File2 contains information on retail revenue, sales, and customer counts, by State and class of service (including the Transportation sector, new in 2003), for each electric distribution utility, or energy service provider in all 50 States, the District of Columbia, the Dominion of Puerto Rico, and the Territories of American Samoa, Guam, and the Virgin Islands.\r\n* File3 contains information on electric utility demand-side management programs, including energy efficiency and load management effects and expenditures, and (2007 forward) the number of customers in time- and incentive-based rate programs (peak data is in megawatts for 2001 forward – in previous years the data are in kilowatts).\r\n* File3a (2007 forward) contains the cost percentages by state of energy efficiency and load management programs.\r\n* File4 contains the names of the counties, by State, in which the respondent has equipment for the distribution of electricity to ultimate consumers.\r\n* File5 contains aggregate data of the number of customers by State and customer class for Green Pricing and Net Metering programs, as well as (for 2007 forward) the revenue and sales from Green Pricing programs and the energy displaced by Net Metering programs.\r\n* File6 contains information on utility or customer-owned distributed and dispersed generation such as the number, capacity and types of generators.\r\n* File7 (2007 forward) contains data on mergers and acquisitions\r\n* File8 (2007 forward) contains data on advanced meters.\r\n\t\t\r\nNote: All sales data, including energy efficiency \r\nsavings, are in megawatthours, peak and peak reduction data are in \r\nmegawatts for 2001 forward and kilowatts for previous years, all revenue\r\n and expenditure data are in thousand-dollar units.\r\n\r\nFinal data for the years 1990 through 1998 are in \r\nself-extracting zip files which expand into 5 DBF files (F861TYP1.DBF, \r\nF861TY2A.DBF, F861TY2B.DBF, F861TYP3.DBF, F861TYP7DBF); and Notepad \r\nversions of the file layout (\"layout\"), the Form EIA-861 (WordPerfect), \r\nand EIA-861 Instructions (instr.wpd). To expand the file, type \r\nF861yy.EXE* (requires 5-6 megs space). The file structure for the years \r\n1990 through 1998 differs from that for the 1999 and 2000 files \r\ndescribed in the preceding paragraph. The primary difference is that \r\nfile F861TYP1.DBF contains a combination of data available in the 1999, \r\n2000, and 2001 in file1.xls and file2.dbf. Utility retail sales data, \r\nfor utilities with sales in 3 or more States are shown in F861TYP3.dbf \r\nfor the third, fourth, fifth, etc., States. Utility Demand-side \r\nManagement information for the years 1990 through 1998 is available in \r\nF861TY2A.DBF and F861TY2B.DBF.\r\n\r\n\\*Note: Substitute the applicable year for \"yy\" in the file name.\r\nFile Size: 550 k\r\n\r\n_If you experience difficulty in \r\ndownloading an EIA electricity database, please try substituting \r\n\"eiainfo2\" in place of \"www\" in the URL address._\r\n\r\nDownload\r\n--------\r\n\r\n_Year_ - _Format(s)_\r\n\r\n2012 - [ZIP](http://www.eia.gov/electricity/data/eia861/zip/f8612012.zip)\r\n\r\n2011 - [ZIP](http://www.eia.gov/electricity/data/eia861/zip/f86111.zip)\r\n\r\n2010 - [ZIP](http://www.eia.gov/electricity/data/eia861/zip/f86110.zip)\r\n\r\n2009 - [DBF](http://www.eia.doe.gov/Ftproot/pub/electricity/f86109.exe) - [ZIP](http://www.eia.doe.gov/Ftproot/pub/electricity/f86109.zip)\r\n\r\n2008 - [DBF](http://www.eia.doe.gov/Ftproot/pub/electricity/f86108.exe) - [ZIP](http://www.eia.doe.gov/Ftproot/pub/electricity/f86108.zip)\r\n\r\n2007 - [DBF](http://www.eia.doe.gov/Ftproot/pub/electricity/f86107.exe) - [ZIP](http://www.eia.doe.gov/Ftproot/pub/electricity/f86107.zip)\r\n\r\n2006 - [DBF](http://www.eia.doe.gov/Ftproot/pub/electricity/f86106.exe) - [ZIP](http://www.eia.doe.gov/Ftproot/pub/electricity/f86106.zip)\r\n\r\n2005 - [DBF](http://www.eia.doe.gov/Ftproot/pub/electricity/f86105.exe) - [ZIP](http://www.eia.doe.gov/Ftproot/pub/electricity/f86105.zip)\r\n\r\n2004 - [DBF](http://www.eia.doe.gov/Ftproot/pub/electricity/f86104.exe) - [ZIP](http://www.eia.doe.gov/Ftproot/pub/electricity/f86104.zip)\r\n\r\n2003 - [DBF](http://www.eia.doe.gov/Ftproot/pub/electricity/f86103.exe) - [ZIP](http://www.eia.doe.gov/Ftproot/pub/electricity/f86103.zip)\r\n\r\n2002 - [DBF](http://www.eia.doe.gov/Ftproot/pub/electricity/f86102.exe) - [ZIP](http://www.eia.doe.gov/Ftproot/pub/electricity/f86102.zip)\r\n\r\n2001 - [DBF](http://www.eia.doe.gov/Ftproot/pub/electricity/f86101.exe) - [ZIP](http://www.eia.doe.gov/Ftproot/pub/electricity/f86101.zip)\r\n\r\n2000 - [DBF](http://www.eia.doe.gov/Ftproot/pub/electricity/f86100.exe) - [ZIP](http://www.eia.doe.gov/Ftproot/pub/electricity/f86100.zip)\r\n\r\n1999 - [DBF](http://www.eia.doe.gov/Ftproot/pub/electricity/f86199.exe) - [ZIP](http://www.eia.doe.gov/Ftproot/pub/electricity/f86199.zip)\r\n\r\n1998 - [DBF](http://www.eia.doe.gov/Ftproot/pub/electricity/f86198.exe) - [ZIP](http://www.eia.doe.gov/Ftproot/pub/electricity/f86198.zip)\r\n\r\n1997 - [DBF](http://www.eia.doe.gov/Ftproot/pub/electricity/f86197.exe) - [ZIP](http://www.eia.doe.gov/Ftproot/pub/electricity/f86197.zip)\r\n\r\n1996 - [DBF](http://www.eia.doe.gov/Ftproot/pub/electricity/f86196.exe) - [ZIP](http://www.eia.doe.gov/Ftproot/pub/electricity/f86196.zip)\r\n\r\n1995 - [DBF](http://www.eia.doe.gov/Ftproot/pub/electricity/f86195.exe) - [ZIP](http://www.eia.doe.gov/Ftproot/pub/electricity/f86195.zip)\r\n\r\n1994 - [DBF](http://www.eia.doe.gov/Ftproot/pub/electricity/f86194.exe) - [ZIP](http://www.eia.doe.gov/Ftproot/pub/electricity/f86194.zip)\r\n\r\n1993 - [DBF](http://www.eia.doe.gov/Ftproot/pub/electricity/f86193.exe) - [ZIP](http://www.eia.doe.gov/Ftproot/pub/electricity/f86193.zip)\r\n\r\n1992 - [DBF](http://www.eia.doe.gov/Ftproot/pub/electricity/f86192.exe) - [ZIP](http://www.eia.doe.gov/Ftproot/pub/electricity/f86192.zip)\r\n\r\n1991 - [DBF](http://www.eia.doe.gov/Ftproot/pub/electricity/f86191.exe) - [ZIP](http://www.eia.doe.gov/Ftproot/pub/electricity/f86191.zip)\r\n\r\n1990 - [DBF](http://www.eia.doe.gov/Ftproot/pub/electricity/f86190.exe) - [ZIP](http://www.eia.doe.gov/Ftproot/pub/electricity/f86190.zip)\r\n\r\nR=Revised Data.

The SWERA application utilizes Geographical Information Systems (GIS) to develop common scenarios to evaluate potential locations for solar or wind energy plants.\r\n\r\n_(Supplemental Information):_   The zip file contains the geospatial toolkit executable, Getting Started Document, and metadata.\r\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nThe GsT was completely redesigned and re-released in November 2010 to provide a more modern, easier-to-use interface with considerably faster analytical querying capabilities. The revised version of the Geospatial Toolkit for Honduras is available using the following link:  http://www.nrel.gov/international/downloads/gst_honduras.exe\r\n\r\n_NOTE:_ Please use the provided link to access the most up to date software package and data.  The Honduras GsT data were last updated in January 2011.  The attached zip file below is an archive and contains the previous version of the geospatial toolkit executable that has been replaced.\r\n\r\nPlease visit [Geospatial Toolkit](http://en.openei.org/wiki/Geospatial_Toolkit) for additional information about the GsT and updates.",

Most of the springs are thermal 2 Geologic Framework of Thermal Springs, Black Canyon, Nevada and Arizona with temperatures as much as 45–55 °C. The study is part of a hydrogeologic and geochemical study of the Black Canyon thermal springs by the U.S. Geological Survey, funded by the National Park Service and National Cooperative Geologic Mapping Program of the U.S. Geological Survey. The study consisted of (1) compilation of existing geologic mapping, augmented by new field geologic mapping and geochronology (Felger and others, 2014), (2) collection and analysis of structural data adjacent to the springs of interest (appendix 1; Anderson and Beard, 2011; Beard and others, 2011a), and (3) construction of regional cross sections (pl. 1). The most significant results identify faults, fracture zones, and rock characteristics that influence the hydrogeology of Black Canyon. Additional results include refinement of the volcanic stratigraphy based on field mapping and new geochronology. This report will be integrated into a companion hydrogeologic report that includes new geochemical and spring flow data that describes groundwater components of Black Canyon thermal springs (M. Moran, written commun, 2013).",

The primary limitation that makes commercial EGS infeasible is our current inability to cost-effectively create high-permeability reservoirs from impermeable, igneous rock within the 3,000-10,000 ft depth range. Our goal is to develop a novel fracturing fluid technology that maximizes reservoir permeability while reducing stimulation cost and environmental impact. Laboratory equipment development to advance laboratory characterization/monitoring is also a priority of this project to study and optimize the physicochemical properties of these fracturing fluids in a range of reservoir conditions. Barrier G is the primarily intended GTO barrier to be addressed as well as support addressing barriers D, E and I.\n",

Theoretical torque specifications are derived based upon a widely-accepted rock-reduction model in the literature using representative properties for typical rock formations.  The derived values correspond to optimum motor performance for rock reduction at minimum specific energy and form a set of minimum requirements on output torque and power for downhole motors.  Actual values should be increased to account for factors such as increased hydrostatic pressure at depth, bit wear, heterogeneous rock, and non-ideal drilling conditions.",

Cylindrical granite and marble samples were subjected to confining pressures of either 0 psi or approximately 2500 psi and internal pressures of either 0 psi, 1500 psi or 2500 psi through a blind axial hole at the center of one end of the sample. The sample diameters were 1.5\" and the sample lengths were 6\". The blind hole was 0.25\" in diameter and 3\" deep. One set of experiments measured strains at points located circumferentially around the center of the sample with identical radii to determine if there was strain variability (this would not be expected for a homogeneous material based on the symmetry of loading). Another set of experiments measured load variation across the radius of the sample at a fixed axial and circumferential location. Raw neutron diffraction intensity files and experimental parameter descriptions are included.",

      "description": "This paper describes the applications of the fractured continuum model to the different enhanced geothermal systems reservoir conditions. The capability of the fractured continuum model to generate fracture characteristics expected in enhanced geothermal systems reservoir environments are demonstrated for single and multiple sets of fractures. Fracture characteristics are defined by fracture strike, dip, spacing, and aperture. The paper demonstrates how the fractured continuum model can be extended to represent continuous fractured features, such as long fractures, and the conditions in which the fracture density varies within the different depth intervals. Simulations of heat transport using different fracture settings were compared with regard to their heat extraction effectiveness. The best heat extraction was obtained in the case when fractures were horizontal. A conventional heat extraction scheme with vertical wells was compared to an alternative scheme with horizontal wells. The heat extraction with the horizontal wells was significantly better than with the vertical wells when the injector was at the bottom.",

      "description": "This a report for the project \"Mapping Fracture Network Creation with Microseismicity During EGS Demonstrations\". Effective enhanced geothermal systems (EGS) require optimal fracture networks for efficient heat transfer between hot rock and fluid. Microseismic mapping is a key tool used to infer the subsurface fracture geometry. Traditional earthquake detection and location techniques are often employed to identify microearthquakes in geothermal regions. However, most commonly used algorithms may miss events if the seismic signal of an earthquake is small relative to the background noise level or if a microearthquake occurs within the coda of a larger event. Consequently, we have developed a set of algorithms that provide improved microearthquake detection. Our objective is to investigate the microseismicity at the DOE Newberry EGS site to better image the active regions of the underground fracture network during and immediately after the EGS stimulation. Detection of more microearthquakes during EGS stimulations will allow for better seismic delineation of the active regions of the underground fracture system. This improved knowledge of the reservoir network will improve our understanding of subsurface conditions, and allow improvement of the stimulation strategy that will optimize heat extraction and maximize economic return. \n\nThis project is the FY14 continuation of FY13 AOP project 25728, which had its origins as the ARRA lab project AID 19981.

The first report made an initial attempt at quantifying the life cycle fresh water requirements of geothermal power-generating systems and explored operational and environmental concerns related to the geochemical composition of geothermal fluids. The initial analysis of life cycle fresh water consumption of geothermal power-generating systems identified that operational water requirements consumed the vast majority of water across the life cycle. However, it relied upon limited operational water consumption data and did not account for belowground operational losses for enhanced geothermal systems (EGSs). A second report presented an initial assessment of fresh water demand for future growth in utility-scale geothermal power generation. The current analysis builds upon this work to improve life cycle fresh water consumption estimates and incorporates regional water availability into the resource assessment to improve the identification of areas where future growth in geothermal electricity generation may encounter water challenges.",

      "title": "Slip and Dilation Tendency Anlysis of Neal Hot Springs Geothermal Area",
      "description": "Slip and Dilation Tendency in focus areas\nCritically stressed fault segments have a relatively high likelihood of acting as fluid flow conduits (Sibson, 1994). As such, the tendency of a fault segment to slip (slip tendency; Ts; Morris et al., 1996) or to dilate (dilation tendency; Td; Ferrill et al., 1999) provides an indication of which faults or fault segments within a geothermal system are critically stressed and therefore likely to transmit geothermal fluids. The slip tendency of a surface is defined by the ratio of shear stress to normal stress on that surface:\nTs = τ / σn \t(Morris et al., 1996).\nDilation tendency is defined by the stress acting normal to a given surface:\nTd = (σ1-σn) / (σ1-σ3) \t(Ferrill et al., 1999). \nSlip and dilation were calculated using 3DStress (Southwest Research Institute).\nSlip and dilation tendency are both unitless ratios of the resolved stresses applied to the fault plane by ambient stress conditions. Values range from a maximum of 1, a fault plane ideally oriented to slip or dilate under ambient stress conditions to zero, a fault plane with no potential to slip or dilate. Slip and dilation tendency values were calculated for each fault in the focus study areas at, McGinness Hills, Neal Hot Springs, Patua, Salt Wells, San Emidio, and Tuscarora on fault traces. As dip is not well constrained or unknown for many faults mapped in within these we made these calculations using the dip for each fault that would yield the maximum slip tendency or dilation tendency. As such, these results should be viewed as maximum tendency of each fault to slip or dilate. The resulting along-fault and fault-to-fault variation in slip or dilation potential is a proxy for along fault and fault-to-fault variation in fluid flow conduit potential.\nStress Magnitudes and directions\nStress field variation within each focus area was approximated based on regional published data and the world stress database (Hickman et al., 2000; Hickman et al., 1998 Robertson-Tait et al., 2004; Hickman and Davatzes, 2010; Davatzes and Hickman, 2006; Blake and Davatzes 2011; Blake and Davatzes, 2012; Moeck et al., 2010; Moos and Ronne, 2010 and Reinecker et al., 2005) as well as local stress information if applicable. For faults within these focus systems we applied either a normal faulting stress regime where the vertical stress (sv) is larger than the maximum horizontal stress (shmax) which is larger than the minimum horizontal stress (sv>shmax>shmin) or strike-slip faulting stress regime where the maximum horizontal stress (shmax) is larger than the vertical stress (sv) which is larger than the minimum horizontal stress (shmax >sv>shmin) depending on the general tectonic province of the system. Based on visual inspection of the limited stress magnitude data in the Great Basin we used magnitudes such that shmin/shmax = .527 and shmin/sv= .46, which are consistent with complete and partial stress field determinations from Desert Peak, Coso, the Fallon area and Dixie valley (Hickman et al., 2000; Hickman et al., 1998 Robertson-Tait et al., 2004; Hickman and Davatzes, 2011; Davatzes and Hickman, 2006; Blake and Davatzes 2011; Blake and Davatzes, 2012). \n\nBased on inversion of fault kinematic data, Edwards (2013) interpreted that two discrete stress orientations are preserved at Neal Hot Springs. An older episode of east-west directed extension and a younger episode of southwest-northeast directed sinistral, oblique -normal extension. This interpretation is consistent with the evolution of Cenozoic tectonics in the region (Edwards, 2013). As such we applied a southwest-northeast (060) directed normal faulting stress regime, consistent with the younger extensional episode, to the Neal Hot Springs faults. \nUnder these stress conditions northeast striking steeply dipping fault segments have the highest tendency to dilate and northeast striking 60° dipping fault segments have the highest tendency to slip. Under these stress conditions, both the Neal Fault and Sugarloaf Butte faults area well-oriented for both slip and dilation and thus for fracture permeability. In addition, several subsidiary faults on the eastern side and within the step-over between the Neal fault and Sugarloaf Butte fault are well oriented for slip and dilation as well.\n",

      "description": "Critically stressed fault segments have a relatively high likelihood of acting as fluid flow conduits (Sibson, 1994). As such, the tendency of a fault segment to slip (slip tendency; Ts; Morris et al., 1996) or to dilate (dilation tendency; Td; Ferrill et al., 1999) provides an indication of which faults or fault segments within a geothermal system are critically stressed and therefore likely to transmit geothermal fluids. The slip tendency of a surface is defined by the ratio of shear stress to normal stress on that surface:\nTs = τ / σn \t(Morris et al., 1996).\nDilation tendency is defined by the stress acting normal to a given surface:\nTd = (σ1-σn) / (σ1-σ3) \t(Ferrill et al., 1999). \nSlip and dilation were calculated using 3DStress (Southwest Research Institute).\nSlip and dilation tendency are both unitless ratios of the resolved stresses applied to the fault plane by ambient stress conditions. Values range from a maximum of 1, a fault plane ideally oriented to slip or dilate under ambient stress conditions to zero, a fault plane with no potential to slip or dilate. Slip and dilation tendency values were calculated for each fault in the focus study areas at, McGinness Hills, Neal Hot Springs, Patua, Salt Wells, San Emidio, and Tuscarora on fault traces. As dip is not well constrained or unknown for many faults mapped in within these we made these calculations using the dip for each fault that would yield the maximum slip tendency or dilation tendency. As such, these results should be viewed as maximum tendency of each fault to slip or dilate. The resulting along-fault and fault-to-fault variation in slip or dilation potential is a proxy for along fault and fault-to-fault variation in fluid flow conduit potential.\nStress Magnitudes and directions\nStress field variation within each focus area was approximated based on regional published data and the world stress database (Hickman et al., 2000; Hickman et al., 1998 Robertson-Tait et al., 2004; Hickman and Davatzes, 2010; Davatzes and Hickman, 2006; Blake and Davatzes 2011; Blake and Davatzes, 2012; Moeck et al., 2010; Moos and Ronne, 2010 and Reinecker et al., 2005) as well as local stress information if applicable. For faults within these focus systems we applied either a normal faulting stress regime where the vertical stress (sv) is larger than the maximum horizontal stress (shmax) which is larger than the minimum horizontal stress (sv>shmax>shmin) or strike-slip faulting stress regime where the maximum horizontal stress (shmax) is larger than the vertical stress (sv) which is larger than the minimum horizontal stress (shmax >sv>shmin) depending on the general tectonic province of the system. Based on visual inspection of the limited stress magnitude data in the Great Basin we used magnitudes such that shmin/shmax = .527 and shmin/sv= .46, which are consistent with complete and partial stress field determinations from Desert Peak, Coso, the Fallon area and Dixie valley (Hickman et al., 2000; Hickman et al., 1998 Robertson-Tait et al., 2004; Hickman and Davatzes, 2011; Davatzes and Hickman, 2006; Blake and Davatzes 2011; Blake and Davatzes, 2012). \n\nSlip and dilation tendency for the Salt Wells geothermal field was calculated based on the faults mapped in the Bunejug Mountains quadrangle (Hinz et al., 2011). The Salt Wells area lies in the Basin and Range Province (N. Hinz personal comm.) As such we applied a normal faulting stress regime to the Salt Wells area faults, with a minimum horizontal stress direction oriented 105, based on inspection of local and regional stress determinations. Under these stress conditions north-northeast striking, steeply dipping fault segments have the highest dilation tendency, while north-northeast striking 60° dipping fault segments have the highest tendency to slip. Several such faults intersect in high density in the core of the accommodation zone in the Bunejug Mountains and local to the Salt Wells geothermal .",

      "description": "Understanding the relationship between stress state, strain state and fracture initiation and propagation is critical to the improvement of fracture simulation capability if it is to be used as a tool for guiding hydraulic fracturing operations. The development of fracture prediction tools is especially critical for geothermal applications such as EGS because the opportunities to build understanding empirically will be limited due to the high costs associated with field trials. There is a significant body of experimental work associated with hydraulic fracture investigation, but past efforts are typically hampered by an inability to accurately and comprehensively measure strains within the sample mass near critical regions of interest.\nThis work aims to develop non-destructive neutron diffraction based strain measurement techniques that can be used to interrogate the internal volume of geological specimens subjected to tri-axial stress states resembling geothermal application conditions. Demonstrating the ability of the technique to generate useful quantitative data is the primary focus at this stage of the effort. Details of the experimental setup and diffraction technique will be presented in this communication, including the description of a custom designed high-pressure, neutron scattering",

Previous reports in this series quantified the life cycle freshwater requirements of geothermal power-generating systems, explored operational and environmental concerns related to the geochemical composition of geothermal fluids, and assessed future water demand by geothermal power plants according to growth projections for the industry. This report seeks to extend those analyses by including EGS flash, both as part of the life cycle analysis and water resource assessment. A regional water resource assessment based upon the life cycle results is also presented. Finally, the legal framework of water with respect to geothermal resources in the states with active geothermal development is also analyzed.",

Completions are typically considered to be the final step of drilling engineering which includes processes such as setting casing, cementing, and perforating to reach the target formation.  Completions provide the conduit from the resource to the surface.  Although completions encompass a wide range of disciplines, several key factors ultimately determine the quality of the completion.  One of those is cementing and centralizing casing within the wellbore.\nThis white paper examines the current state of the art for centralizers in the context of well completions.  The paper will include an introductory primer on well completions to provide the framework for the centralizer discussions.  The types of centralizers currently available and how they are used will be discussed in addition to alternative centralizer techniques. ",

      "description": "Critically stressed fault segments have a relatively high likelihood of acting as fluid flow conduits (Sibson, 1994). As such, the tendency of a fault segment to slip (slip tendency; Ts; Morris et al., 1996) or to dilate (dilation tendency; Td; Ferrill et al., 1999) provides an indication of which faults or fault segments within a geothermal system are critically stressed and therefore likely to transmit geothermal fluids. The slip tendency of a surface is defined by the ratio of shear stress to normal stress on that surface:\nTs = τ / σn \t(Morris et al., 1996).\nDilation tendency is defined by the stress acting normal to a given surface:\nTd = (σ1-σn) / (σ1-σ3) \t(Ferrill et al., 1999). \nSlip and dilation were calculated using 3DStress (Southwest Research Institute).\nSlip and dilation tendency are both unitless ratios of the resolved stresses applied to the fault plane by ambient stress conditions. Values range from a maximum of 1, a fault plane ideally oriented to slip or dilate under ambient stress conditions to zero, a fault plane with no potential to slip or dilate. Slip and dilation tendency values were calculated for each fault in the focus study areas at, McGinness Hills, Neal Hot Springs, Patua, Salt Wells, San Emidio, and Tuscarora on fault traces. As dip is not well constrained or unknown for many faults mapped in within these we made these calculations using the dip for each fault that would yield the maximum slip tendency or dilation tendency. As such, these results should be viewed as maximum tendency of each fault to slip or dilate. The resulting along-fault and fault-to-fault variation in slip or dilation potential is a proxy for along fault and fault-to-fault variation in fluid flow conduit potential.\nStress Magnitudes and directions\nStress field variation within each focus area was approximated based on regional published data and the world stress database (Hickman et al., 2000; Hickman et al., 1998 Robertson-Tait et al., 2004; Hickman and Davatzes, 2010; Davatzes and Hickman, 2006; Blake and Davatzes 2011; Blake and Davatzes, 2012; Moeck et al., 2010; Moos and Ronne, 2010 and Reinecker et al., 2005) as well as local stress information if applicable. For faults within these focus systems we applied either a normal faulting stress regime where the vertical stress (sv) is larger than the maximum horizontal stress (shmax) which is larger than the minimum horizontal stress (sv>shmax>shmin) or strike-slip faulting stress regime where the maximum horizontal stress (shmax) is larger than the vertical stress (sv) which is larger than the minimum horizontal stress (shmax >sv>shmin) depending on the general tectonic province of the system. Based on visual inspection of the limited stress magnitude data in the Great Basin we used magnitudes such that shmin/shmax = .527 and shmin/sv= .46, which are consistent with complete and partial stress field determinations from Desert Peak, Coso, the Fallon area and Dixie valley (Hickman et al., 2000; Hickman et al., 1998 Robertson-Tait et al., 2004; Hickman and Davatzes, 2011; Davatzes and Hickman, 2006; Blake and Davatzes 2011; Blake and Davatzes, 2012). \n\nSlip and dilation tendency for the San Emidio geothermal field was calculated based on the faults mapped Tuscarora area (Rhodes, 2011). The San Emidio area lies in the Basin and Range Province, as such we applied a normal faulting stress regime to the San Emidio area faults, with a minimum horizontal stress direction oriented 115, based on inspection of local and regional stress determinations, as explained above. This is consistent with the shmin determined through inversion of fault data by Rhodes (2011). Under these stress conditions north-northeast striking, steeply dipping fault segments have the highest dilation tendency, while north-northeast striking 60° dipping fault segments have the highest tendency to slip. Interesting, the San Emidio geothermal field lies in an area of primarily north striking faults, which have moderate dilation tendency and moderate to low slip tendency.",

      "description": "Slip and Dilation Tendency in focus areas\nCritically stressed fault segments have a relatively high likelihood of acting as fluid flow conduits (Sibson, 1994). As such, the tendency of a fault segment to slip (slip tendency; Ts; Morris et al., 1996) or to dilate (dilation tendency; Td; Ferrill et al., 1999) provides an indication of which faults or fault segments within a geothermal system are critically stressed and therefore likely to transmit geothermal fluids. The slip tendency of a surface is defined by the ratio of shear stress to normal stress on that surface:\nTs = τ / σn \t(Morris et al., 1996).\nDilation tendency is defined by the stress acting normal to a given surface:\nTd = (σ1-σn) / (σ1-σ3) \t(Ferrill et al., 1999). \nSlip and dilation were calculated using 3DStress (Southwest Research Institute).\nSlip and dilation tendency are both unitless ratios of the resolved stresses applied to the fault plane by ambient stress conditions. Values range from a maximum of 1, a fault plane ideally oriented to slip or dilate under ambient stress conditions to zero, a fault plane with no potential to slip or dilate. Slip and dilation tendency values were calculated for each fault in the focus study areas at, McGinness Hills, Neal Hot Springs, Patua, Salt Wells, San Emidio, and Tuscarora on fault traces. As dip is not well constrained or unknown for many faults mapped in within these we made these calculations using the dip for each fault that would yield the maximum slip tendency or dilation tendency. As such, these results should be viewed as maximum tendency of each fault to slip or dilate. The resulting along-fault and fault-to-fault variation in slip or dilation potential is a proxy for along fault and fault-to-fault variation in fluid flow conduit potential.\nStress Magnitudes and directions\nStress field variation within each focus area was approximated based on regional published data and the world stress database (Hickman et al., 2000; Hickman et al., 1998 Robertson-Tait et al., 2004; Hickman and Davatzes, 2010; Davatzes and Hickman, 2006; Blake and Davatzes 2011; Blake and Davatzes, 2012; Moeck et al., 2010; Moos and Ronne, 2010 and Reinecker et al., 2005) as well as local stress information if applicable. For faults within these focus systems we applied either a normal faulting stress regime where the vertical stress (sv) is larger than the maximum horizontal stress (shmax) which is larger than the minimum horizontal stress (sv>shmax>shmin) or strike-slip faulting stress regime where the maximum horizontal stress (shmax) is larger than the vertical stress (sv) which is larger than the minimum horizontal stress (shmax >sv>shmin) depending on the general tectonic province of the system. Based on visual inspection of the limited stress magnitude data in the Great Basin we used magnitudes such that shmin/shmax = .527 and shmin/sv= .46, which are consistent with complete and partial stress field determinations from Desert Peak, Coso, the Fallon area and Dixie valley (Hickman et al., 2000; Hickman et al., 1998 Robertson-Tait et al., 2004; Hickman and Davatzes, 2011; Davatzes and Hickman, 2006; Blake and Davatzes 2011; Blake and Davatzes, 2012). \n\nSlip and dilation tendency for the McGinness Hills geothermal field was calculated based on the faults mapped McGinness Hills area (Siler 2012, unpublished). The McGinness Hills area lies in the Basin and Range Province, as such we applied a normal faulting stress regime to the McGinness area faults, with a minimum horizontal stress direction oriented 115, based on inspection of local and regional stress determinations, as explained above. Under these stress conditions north-northeast striking, steeply dipping fault segments have the highest dilation tendency, while north-northeast striking 60° dipping fault segments have the highest tendency to slip. The McGinness Hills geothermal system is characterized by a left-step in a north-northeast striking west-dipping fault system within a north northeast striking accommodation zone. As such, the normal faults that define these two structures are well oriented for both slip and dilation, including the west dipping faults that are exploited for both production and injection. Interestingly, although there is pressure communication between production and injection wells at McGinness Hills (B. Delwiche, personal comm.) the northwest striking fault, which creates hard linkage between the production and injection locations, is poorly oriented for both slip and dilation and therefore unlikely to host permeability.",

Within this broad accommodation zone lies a fault step-over defined by north-northeast striking, west-dipping normal faults which step to the left at roughly the latitude of the McGinness Hills geothermal system. The McGinness Hills 3D model consists of 9 geologic units and 41 faults. The basal geologic units are metasediments of the Ordovician Valmy and Vininni Formations (undifferentiated in the model) which are intruded by Jurassic granitic rocks. Unconformably overlying is a ~100s m-thick section of Tertiary andesitic lava flows and four Oligocene-to-Miocene ash-flow tuffs: The Rattlesnake Canyon Tuff, tuff of Sutcliffe, the Cambell Creek Tuff and the Nine Hill tuff. Overlying are sequences of pre-to-syn-extensional Quaternary alluvium and post-extensional Quaternary alluvium. 10-15º eastward dip of the Tertiary stratigraphy is controlled by the predominant west-dipping fault set. Geothermal production comes from two west dipping normal faults in the northern limb of the step over. Injection is into west dipping faults in the southern limb of the step over. Production and injection sites are in hydrologic communication, but at a deep level, as the northwest striking fault that links the southern and northern limbs of the step-over has no permeability.\n",

      "description": "Detailed geologic mapping (1:24,000 scale), structural and geochemical analyses,\nand integration of available geophysical and well-field data were utilized to assess the\nstructural controls of the Neal Hot Springs geothermal field in eastern Oregon. The\ngeothermal field lies within the intersection of two regional grabens, the middle-late\nMiocene, north-trending, Oregon-Idaho graben and younger late Miocene to Holocene,\nnorthwest-trending, western Snake River Plain graben. It is marked by Neal Hot Springs,\nwhich effuse from opaline sinter mounds just north of Bully Creek. Production and\ninjection wells, with temperatures up to 142°C, intersect the Neal fault zone at depths of\n680-1900 m and subsidiary faults within a relay ramp or step-over within the fault zone.\nThe stratigraphy at Neal correlates with four regional packages. Basement rocks,\ndiscovered in one well, are granite, tentatively correlated with Jurassic Olds Ferry-Izee\nterrane. Nonconformably above is a thick package of middle Miocene Columbia River\nBasalt Group lavas, regionally known as the basalt of Malheur Gorge. Conformably\nabove are middle to late Miocene Oregon-Idaho graben lavas, volcaniclastics, fluvial and\nlacustrine rocks. Overlying are the youngest rocks at Neal, which are late Miocene to\nPliocene, western Snake River Plain lacustrine, fluvial, and volcaniclastic rocks.\nThe structural framework at Neal is characterized by northerly to northweststriking\nnormal faults, including the geothermally related Neal fault zone. Stress\ninversion of kinematic data reveal an extensional stress regime, including an interpreted\nyounger, southwest-trending (~243°), least principal stress and an older, west-trending\n(~265°) least principal stress.\nThe geothermal field is bounded on the east by the Neal fault, a major, westdipping,\nnorth-northwest-striking, steeply dipping normal to oblique-slip fault, along\nwhich geothermal fluids ascend, and on the west by the concealed north-northweststriking,\nwest-dipping Sugarloaf Butte fault. The Neal fault zone can be modeled into two\nstructural settings: an interpreted older, left-stepping, normal-slip fault zone and a\nyounger, oblique sinistral-normal zone, suggested by the earlier west-trending and later\nsouthwest-trending extensional stress regimes. Recent sinistral-normal displacement may\nhave generated a small pull-apart basin in the Neal area and facilitated development of\nthe geothermal system. 'Hard-linkage' between the Neal and Sugarloaf Butte faults\noccurs through concealed, west-northwest-striking faults, including the Cottonwood\nCreek subvertical fault, along which lateral fluid-flow is likely. An inferred northplunging\nfault intersection at the Neal Hot Springs likely controls the location of the hot\nsprings and sinter terraces.\nYoung structural features are evident at Neal. The Neal fault zone cuts\nQuaternary fans and late Miocene lower and upper Bully Creek Formation sedimentary\nrocks. In addition, the geothermal field is 4 km west of the active, north- to northweststriking,\nnormal-slip Cottonwood Mountain fault. Furthermore, the field is within several\nkilometers of recently detected seismicity. This, coupled with its active hot springs\n(~90°C), opaline sinter mounds, and geothermal fluid flow, suggest that the geothermal\nfield lies within an active (Quaternary), southward-terminating, left-stepping fault zone,\nwhich locally acts as a pull-apart basin with sinistral- and normal-slip components.",

      "title": "Structural Controls of the Tuscarora Geothermal Field, Elko County, Nevada - MS Thesis",
      "description": "Detailed geologic mapping, structural analysis, and well data have been integrated to elucidate the stratigraphic framework and structural setting of the Tuscarora geothermal area. Tuscarora is an amagmatic geothermal system that lies in the northern part of the Basin and Range province, ~15 km southeast of the Snake River Plain and ~90 km northwest of Elko, Nevada. The Tuscarora area is dominated by late Eocene to middle Miocene volcanic and sedimentary rocks, all overlying Paleozoic metasedimentary rocks. A geothermal power plant was constructed in 2011 and currently produces 18 MWe from an ~170°C reservoir in metasedimentary rocks at a depth of ~1430 m. Analysis of drill core reveals that the subsurface geology is dominated to depths of ~700-1000 m by intracaldera deposits of the Eocene Big Cottonwood Canyon caldera, including blocks of basement-derived megabreccia. Furthermore, the Tertiary-Paleozoic nonconformity within the geothermal field has been recognized as the margin of this Eocene caldera. Structural relations combined with geochronologic data from previous studies indicate that Tuscarora has undergone extension since the late Eocene, with significant extension in the late Miocene-Pliocene to early Pleistocene. Kinematic analysis of fault slip data reveal an east-west-trending least principal paleostress direction, which probably reflects an earlier episode of Miocene extension.\nTwo distinct structural settings at different scales appear to control the geothermal field. The regional structural setting is a 10-km wide complexly faulted left step or relay ramp in the west-dipping range-bounding Independence-Bull Run Mountains normal fault system. Geothermal activity occurs within the step-over where sets of east- and west-dipping normal faults overlap in a northerly trending accommodation zone. The distribution of hot wells and hydrothermal surface features, including boiling springs, fumaroles, and siliceous sinter, indicate that the geothermal system is restricted to the narrow (< 1 km) axial part of the accommodation zone, where permeability is maintained at depth around complex fault intersections. Shallow up-flow appears to be focused along several closely spaced steeply west-dipping north-northeast-striking normal faults within the axial part of the accommodation zone. These faults are favorably oriented for extension and fluid flow under the present-day northwest-trending regional extension direction indicated by previous studies of GPS geodetic data, earthquake focal mechanisms, and kinematic data from late Quaternary faults.\nThe recognition of the axial part of an accommodation zone as a favorable structural setting for geothermal activity may be a useful exploration tool for development of drilling targets in extensional terranes, as well as for developing geologic models of known geothermal fields. Preliminary analysis of broad step-overs similar to Tuscarora reveals that geothermal activity occurs in a variety of subsidiary structural settings within these regions. In addition, the presence of several high-temperature systems in northeastern Nevada demonstrates the viability of electrical-grade geothermal activity in this region despite low present-day strain rates as indicated by GPS geodetic data. Geothermal exploration potential in northeastern Nevada may therefore be higher than previously recognized.\n",

Such areas have multiple, overlapping fault strands, increased fracture density, and thus enhanced permeability. Other common settings include a) intersections between normal faults and strike-slip or oblique-slip faults (22%), where multiple minor faults connect major structures and fluids can flow readily through highly fractured, dilational quadrants, and b) normal fault terminations or tip-lines (22%), where horse-tailing generates closely-spaced faults and increased permeability. Other settings include accommodation zones (i.e., belts of intermeshing, oppositely dipping normal faults; 8%), major normal faults (6%), displacement transfer zones (5%), and pull-aparts in strike-slip faults (4%). In addition, Quaternary faults lie within or near most systems (e.g., Bell and Ramelli, 2007). The relative scarcity of geothermal systems along displacement-maxima of major normal faults may be due to reduced permeability in thick zones of clay gouge and periodic release of stress in major earthquakes.

      "title": "Slip and Dilation Tendency Analysis of the Tuscarora Geothermal Area",
      "description": "Critically stressed fault segments have a relatively high likelihood of acting as fluid flow conduits (Sibson, 1994). As such, the tendency of a fault segment to slip (slip tendency; Ts; Morris et al., 1996) or to dilate (dilation tendency; Td; Ferrill et al., 1999) provides an indication of which faults or fault segments within a geothermal system are critically stressed and therefore likely to transmit geothermal fluids. The slip tendency of a surface is defined by the ratio of shear stress to normal stress on that surface:\nTs = τ / σn \t(Morris et al., 1996).\nDilation tendency is defined by the stress acting normal to a given surface:\nTd = (σ1-σn) / (σ1-σ3) \t(Ferrill et al., 1999). \nSlip and dilation were calculated using 3DStress (Southwest Research Institute).\nSlip and dilation tendency are both unitless ratios of the resolved stresses applied to the fault plane by ambient stress conditions. Values range from a maximum of 1, a fault plane ideally oriented to slip or dilate under ambient stress conditions to zero, a fault plane with no potential to slip or dilate. Slip and dilation tendency values were calculated for each fault in the focus study areas at, McGinness Hills, Neal Hot Springs, Patua, Salt Wells, San Emidio, and Tuscarora on fault traces. As dip is not well constrained or unknown for many faults mapped in within these we made these calculations using the dip for each fault that would yield the maximum slip tendency or dilation tendency. As such, these results should be viewed as maximum tendency of each fault to slip or dilate. The resulting along-fault and fault-to-fault variation in slip or dilation potential is a proxy for along fault and fault-to-fault variation in fluid flow conduit potential.\nStress Magnitudes and directions\nStress field variation within each focus area was approximated based on regional published data and the world stress database (Hickman et al., 2000; Hickman et al., 1998 Robertson-Tait et al., 2004; Hickman and Davatzes, 2010; Davatzes and Hickman, 2006; Blake and Davatzes 2011; Blake and Davatzes, 2012; Moeck et al., 2010; Moos and Ronne, 2010 and Reinecker et al., 2005) as well as local stress information if applicable. For faults within these focus systems we applied either a normal faulting stress regime where the vertical stress (sv) is larger than the maximum horizontal stress (shmax) which is larger than the minimum horizontal stress (sv>shmax>shmin) or strike-slip faulting stress regime where the maximum horizontal stress (shmax) is larger than the vertical stress (sv) which is larger than the minimum horizontal stress (shmax >sv>shmin) depending on the general tectonic province of the system. Based on visual inspection of the limited stress magnitude data in the Great Basin we used magnitudes such that shmin/shmax = .527 and shmin/sv= .46, which are consistent with complete and partial stress field determinations from Desert Peak, Coso, the Fallon area and Dixie valley (Hickman et al., 2000; Hickman et al., 1998 Robertson-Tait et al., 2004; Hickman and Davatzes, 2011; Davatzes and Hickman, 2006; Blake and Davatzes 2011; Blake and Davatzes, 2012). \n\nSlip and dilation tendency for the Tuscarora geothermal field was calculated based on the faults mapped Tuscarora area (Dering, 2013). The Tuscarora area lies in the Basin and Range Province, as such we applied a normal faulting stress regime to the Tuscarora area faults, with a minimum horizontal stress direction oriented 115, based on inspection of local and regional stress determinations, as explained above. Under these stress conditions north-northeast striking, steeply dipping fault segments have the highest dilation tendency, while north-northeast striking 60° dipping fault segments have the highest tendency to slip. Tuscarora is defined by a left-step in a major north- to-north northeast striking, west-dipping range-bounding normal fault system. Faults within the broad step define an anticlinal accommodation zone wherein east-dipping faults mainly occupy western half of the accommodation zone and west-dipping faults lie in the eastern half of the accommodation zone. The geothermal system resides in the axial part of the accommodation, straddling the two fault dip domains. Within the axial part of the accommodation zone several west-dipping, north northeast-striking faults are well oriented for both slip and dilation, including fault strands that are exploited for both production and injection for the Tuscarora geothermal power plant.",

As such, the tendency of a fault segment to slip (slip tendency; Ts; Morris et al., 1996) or to dilate (dilation tendency; Td; Ferrill et al., 1999) provides an indication of which faults or fault segments within a geothermal system are critically stressed and therefore likely to transmit geothermal fluids. The slip tendency of a surface is defined by the ratio of shear stress to normal stress on that surface:\nTs = τ / σn \t(Morris et al., 1996).\nDilation tendency is defined by the stress acting normal to a given surface:\nTd = (σ1-σn) / (σ1-σ3) \t(Ferrill et al., 1999). \nSlip and dilation were calculated using 3DStress (Southwest Research Institute).\nSlip and dilation tendency are both unitless ratios of the resolved stresses applied to the fault plane by ambient stress conditions. Values range from a maximum of 1, a fault plane ideally oriented to slip or dilate under ambient stress conditions to zero, a fault plane with no potential to slip or dilate. Slip and dilation tendency values were calculated for each fault in the focus study areas at, McGinness Hills, Neal Hot Springs, Patua, Salt Wells, San Emidio, and Tuscarora on fault traces. As dip is not well constrained or unknown for many faults mapped in within these we made these calculations using the dip for each fault that would yield the maximum slip tendency or dilation tendency. As such, these results should be viewed as maximum tendency of each fault to slip or dilate. The resulting along-fault and fault-to-fault variation in slip or dilation potential is a proxy for along fault and fault-to-fault variation in fluid flow conduit potential.\nStress Magnitudes and directions\nStress field variation within each focus area was approximated based on regional published data and the world stress database (Hickman et al., 2000; Hickman et al., 1998 Robertson-Tait et al., 2004; Hickman and Davatzes, 2010; Davatzes and Hickman, 2006; Blake and Davatzes 2011; Blake and Davatzes, 2012; Moeck et al., 2010; Moos and Ronne, 2010 and Reinecker et al., 2005) as well as local stress information if applicable. For faults within these focus systems we applied either a normal faulting stress regime where the vertical stress (sv) is larger than the maximum horizontal stress (shmax) which is larger than the minimum horizontal stress (sv>shmax>shmin) or strike-slip faulting stress regime where the maximum horizontal stress (shmax) is larger than the vertical stress (sv) which is larger than the minimum horizontal stress (shmax >sv>shmin) depending on the general tectonic province of the system. Based on visual inspection of the limited stress magnitude data in the Great Basin we used magnitudes such that shmin/shmax = .527 and shmin/sv= .46, which are consistent with complete and partial stress field determinations from Desert Peak, Coso, the Fallon area and Dixie valley (Hickman et al., 2000; Hickman et al., 1998 Robertson-Tait et al., 2004; Hickman and Davatzes, 2011; Davatzes and Hickman, 2006; Blake and Davatzes 2011; Blake and Davatzes, 2012). \n\nSlip and dilation tendency for the Tuscarora geothermal field was calculated based on the faults mapped Tuscarora area (Dering, 2013). The Tuscarora area lies in the Basin and Range Province, as such we applied a normal faulting stress regime to the Tuscarora area faults, with a minimum horizontal stress direction oriented 115, based on inspection of local and regional stress determinations, as explained above. Under these stress conditions north-northeast striking, steeply dipping fault segments have the highest dilation tendency, while north-northeast striking 60° dipping fault segments have the highest tendency to slip. Tuscarora is defined by a left-step in a major north- to-north northeast striking, west-dipping range-bounding normal fault system. Faults within the broad step define an anticlinal accommodation zone wherein east-dipping faults mainly occupy western half of the accommodation zone and west-dipping faults lie in the eastern half of the accommodation zone. The geothermal system resides in the axial part of the accommodation, straddling the two fault dip domains. Within the axial part of the accommodation zone several west-dipping, north northeast-striking faults are well oriented for both slip and dilation, including fault strands that are exploited for both production and injection for the Tuscarora geothermal power plant.",

In order to characterize this stress variation we calculated slip tendency at Patua for both normal faulting and strike slip faulting stress regimes. Based on examination of regional and local stress data (as explained above) we applied at shmin direction of 105 to Patua. Whether the vertical stress (sv) magnitude is larger than the maximum horizontal stress (shmax) a normal faulting stress regime or the maximum horizontal stress (shmax) magnitude is larger than the vertical stress (sv), a strike-slip faulting stress regime, has very little effect on the dilation tendency, which is controlled by the stresses acting normal to fault planes. As such the dilation tendency results for a strike-slip faulting stress regime and for a normal faulting stress regime are virtually identical, so we present one result for dilation tendency applicable to both strike-slip and normal faulting stress conditions along with slip tendency for both a normal faulting and a strike-slip faulting stress regime. Under these stress conditions, north-northeast striking steeply dipping fault segments have the highest dilation tendency. Under the strike-slip faulting stress regime, north-northwest and east-northeast striking, steeply dipping fault have the highest slip tendency, while under normal faulting conditions north northeast striking, 60° dipping faults have the highest slip tendency.",

      "description": "A detailed gravity survey was carried out for the entire Carson Sink in western Nevada (Figure 1) through a subcontract to Zonge Engineering, Inc. The Carson Sink is a large composite basin containing three known, blind high‐temperature geothermal systems (Fallon Airbase, Stillwater, and Soda Lake). This area was chosen for a detailed gravity survey in order to characterize the gravity signature of the known geothermal systems and to identify other potential blind systems based on the structural setting indicated by the gravity data.\nData: Data were acquired at approximately 400, 800, and 1600 meter intervals for a total of 1,243 stations. The project location and station location points are presented in Figure 14. The station distribution for this survey was designed to complete regional gravity coverage in the Carson Sink area without duplication of available public and private gravity coverage. Gravity data were acquired using a Scintrex CG‐5 gravimeter and a LaCoste and Romberg (L&R) Model‐G gravimeter. The CG‐5 gravity meter has a reading resolution of 0.001 milligals and a typical repeatability of less than 0.005 milligals. The L&R gravity meter has a reading resolution of 0.01 milligals and a typical repeatability of 0.02 milligals. The basic processing of gravimeter readings to calculate through to the Complete Bouguer Anomaly was made using the Gravity and Terrain Correction software version 7.1 for Oasis Montaj by Geosoft LTD.\nResults: The gravity survey of the Carson Sink yielded the following products.\n\nProject location and station location map (Figure 14).\n\nComplete Bouguer Anomaly @ 2.67 gm/cc reduction density.\n\nGravity Complete Bouguer Anomaly at 2.50 g/cc Contour Map (Figure 15).\n\nGravity Horizontal Gradient Magnitude Shaded Color Contour Map.\n\nGravity 1st Vertical Derivative Color Contour Map.\n\nInterpreted Depth to Mesozoic Basement (Figure 16), incorporating drill‐hole intercept values.\nPreliminary Interpretation of Results:\n\nThe Carson Sink is a complex composite basin with several major depocenters (Figures 15 and 16).\n\nMajor depocenters are present in the south‐central, east‐central, and northeastern parts of the basin.\n\nThe distribution of gravity anomalies suggests a complex pattern of faulting in the subsurface of the basin, with many fault terminations, step‐overs, and accommodation zones.\n\nThe pattern of faulting implies that other, previously undiscovered blind geothermal systems are likely in the Carson Sink.\n\nThe gravity survey was completed near the end of this project. Thus, more thorough analysis of the data and potential locations of blind geothermal systems is planned for future work. \n",

For example, field excursions to the following areas included visits of multiple geothermal systems:\n- Northwestern Nevada: Baltazor Hot Spring, Blue Mountain, Bog Hot Spring, Dyke Hot Springs, Howard Hot Spring, MacFarlane Hot Spring, McGee Mountain, and Pinto Hot Springs in northwest Nevada.\n- North‐central to northeastern Nevada: Beowawe, Crescent Valley (Hot Springs Point), Dann Ranch (Hand‐me‐Down Hot Springs), Golconda, and Pumpernickel Valley (Tipton Hot Springs) in north‐central to northeast Nevada.\n- Eastern Nevada: Ash Springs, Chimney Hot Spring, Duckwater, Hiko Hot Spring, Hot Creek Butte, Iverson Spring, Moon River Hot Spring, Moorman Spring, Railroad Valley, and Williams Hot Spring in eastern Nevada.\n- Southwestern Nevada‐eastern California: Walley’s Hot Spring, Antelope Valley, Fales Hot Springs, Buckeye Hot Springs, Travertine Hot Springs, Teels Marsh, Rhodes Marsh, Columbus Marsh, Alum‐Silver Peak, Fish Lake Valley, Gabbs Valley, Wild Rose, Rawhide‐ Wedell Hot Springs, Alkali Hot Springs, and Baileys/Hicks/Burrell Hot Springs.\n- Southern Oregon: Alvord Hot Spring, Antelope Hot Spring‐Hart Mountain, Borax Lake, Crump Geyser, and Mickey Hot Spring in southern Oregon.\n- Western Utah: Newcastle, Veyo Hot Spring, Dixie Hot Spring, Thermo, Roosevelt, Cove Fort, Red Hill Hot Spring, Joseph Hot Spring, Hatton Hot Spring, and Abraham‐Baker Hot Springs.\n\nStructural controls of 426 geothermal systems were analyzed with literature research, air photos, google‐Earth imagery, and/or field reviews (Figures 1 and 2). Of the systems analyzed, we were able to determine the structural settings of more than 240 sites. However, we found that many “systems” consisted of little more than a warm or hot well in the central part of a basin. Such “systems” were difficult to evaluate in terms of structural setting in areas lacking in geophysical data.\n\nDeveloped database for structural catalogue in a master spreadsheet. Data components include structural setting, primary fault orientation, presence or absence of Quaternary faulting, reservoir lithology, geothermometry, presence or absence of recent magmatism, and distinguishing blind systems from those that have surface expressions.\n\nReviewed site locations for all 426 geothermal systems– Confirmed and/or relocated spring and geothermal sites based on imagery, maps, and other information for master database. Many systems were mislocated in the original database. In addition, some systems that included several separate springs spread over large areas were divided into two or more distinct systems. Further, all hot wells were assigned names based on their location to facilitate subsequent analyses.\nWe catalogued systems into the following eight major groups, based on the dominant pattern of faulting (Figure 1):\n- Major normal fault segments (i.e., near displacement maxima).\n- Fault bends.\n- Fault terminations or tips.\n- Step‐overs or relay ramps in normal faults.\n- Fault intersections.\n- Accommodation zones (i.e., belts of intermeshing oppositely dipping normal faults),\n- Displacement transfer zones whereby strike‐slip faults terminate in arrays of normal faults.\n- Transtensional pull‐aparts.\n\nThese settings form a hierarchal pattern with respect to fault complexity.\n- Major normal faults and fault bends are the simplest.\n- Fault terminations are typically more complex than mid‐segments, as faults commonly break up into multiple strands or horsetail near their ends.\n- A fault intersection is generally more complex, as it generally contains both multiple fault strands and can include discrete dilational quadrants.\n- A step‐over consists of two overlapping fault terminations and thus involves additional complexity, especially where the relay ramp is breached by multiple fault splays between the main overlapping faults and thus contains multiple fault intersections.\n- Accommodation zones involve further complexity, as they contain multiple fault terminations and fault intersections.\n\nOf the 426 fields analyzed, major findings include (Figures 1 and 2):\n- 39% of the known systems are blind or hidden (Figure 1), with no surface hot springs or fumaroles.\n- The structural setting for ~25% of the systems could not be determined (Figure 2). In most cases, undetermined systems reside in the central part of a basin (commonly warm wells) that lacks adequate geophysical data for elucidating the subsurface structure.\n- Step‐overs or relay ramps in normal faults are the most favorable setting (Figure 2), hosting ~32% of the systems analyzed. Such areas are characterized by multiple, commonly overlapping fault strands, increased fracture density, and thus enhanced permeability.\n- Normal fault terminations host 25%.\n- Intersections of normal faults and strike‐slip or oblique‐slip faults host 22%.\n- Accommodation zones (belts of intermeshing oppositely dipping normal faults) host 9%.\n- Displacement transfer zones host 5%.\n- Pull‐aparts in strike‐slip faults host 3%.\n- Bends in major normal faults host 2%.\n- Major range‐front faults host 1% of the known systems.\nSome of the more robust systems contain more than one type of structural setting. These include Steamboat, Coso, and Dixie Valley. About 21% of the fields are hybrid or compound systems.\n\nPull‐aparts and displacement transfer zones are more abundant in the transtensional western part of the Great Basin.\n\nAn analysis of the relations between Quaternary faulting and geothermal systems was completed for the Great Basin region. The 426 localities were overlain on USGS Quaternary fault database in GoogleEarth to evaluate proximity to mapped faults and look for unrecognized faults.\n- Quaternary faults typically lie within or near most of the geothermal systems.\n- Geothermal fields were evaluated with proximity to Quaternary faults classified in 4 categories: <1 km, 1‐2 km, 1‐5 km, 1‐10 km.\n- Fault ages were classified as historical, Holocene, late Pleistocene, mid‐Pleistocene, and Quaternary undivided.\n- The highest percentage of high‐temp sites are within 2 km of Quaternary faults. This suggests a statistical correlation between proximity to active faults and high‐temp resources.\n\nGeothermal systems are rare along major range‐front faults, possibly due to both reduced permeability in thick zones of clay gouge and periodic release of stress in major earthquakes.\n\nStep‐overs, terminations, intersections, and accommodation zones correspond to long‐term, critically stressed areas, where fluid pathways would more likely remain open in networks of closely‐spaced, breccia‐dominated fractures.\n",

      "description": "Slip and dilation tendency on the Great Basin fault surfaces (from the USGS Quaternary Fault Database) were calculated using 3DStress (software produced by Southwest Research Institute).\n\nSlip and dilation tendency are both unitless ratios of the resolved stresses applied to the fault plane by the measured ambient stress field.\n- Values range from a maximum of 1 (a fault plane ideally oriented to slip or dilate under ambient stress conditions) to zero (a fault plane with no potential to slip or dilate).\n- Slip and dilation tendency values were calculated for each fault in the Great Basin. As dip is unknown for many faults in the USGS Quaternary Fault Database, we made these calculations using the dip for each fault that would yield the maximum slip or dilation tendency. As such, these results should be viewed as maximum slip and dilation tendency.\n- The resulting along‐fault and fault‐to‐fault variation in slip or dilation potential is a proxy for along fault and fault‐to‐fault variation in fluid flow conduit potential.\n\nStress Magnitudes and directions were calculated across the entire Great Basin. Stress field variation within each focus area was approximated based on regional published data and the world stress database (Hickman et al., 2000; Hickman et al., 1998 Robertson‐Tait et al., 2004; Hickman and Davatzes, 2010; Davatzes and Hickman, 2006; Blake and Davatzes 2011; Blake and Davatzes, 2012; Moeck et al., 2010; Moos and Ronne, 2010 and Reinecker et al., 2005).\n\nThe minimum horizontal stress direction (Shmin) was contoured, and spatial bins with common Shmin directions were calculated. Based on this technique, we subdivided the Great Basin into nine regions (Shmin <070, 070<Shmin<080, 080<Shmin<090, 090<Shmin<100, 100<Shmin<110, 110<Shmin<120, 120<Shmin<130, 130<Shmin<140, Shmin>140). Slip and dilation tendency were calculated using 3DStress for the faults within each region using the mean Shmin for the region. Shmin variation throughout Great Basin are shown on Figure 3.\n\nFor faults within the Great Basin proper, we applied a normal faulting stress regime, where the vertical stress (sv) is larger than the maximum horizontal stress (shmax), which is larger than the minimum horizontal stress (sv>shmax>shmin). Based on visual inspection of the limited stress magnitude data in the Great Basin, we used magnitudes such that shmin/shmax = .527 and shmin/sv= .46. These values are consistent with stress magnitude data at both Dixie Valley (Hickman et al., 2000) and Yucca Mountain (Stock et al., 1985).\n\nFor faults within the Walker Lane/Eastern California Shear Zone, we applied a strike‐slip faulting stress, where shmax > sv > shmin. Upon visual inspection of limited stress magnitude data from the Walker Lane and Eastern California Shear zone, we chose values such that SHmin/SHmax = .46 and Shmin/Sv= .527 representative of the region. \n\nResults: The results of our slip and dilation tendency analysis are shown in Figures 4 (dilation tendency), 5 (slip tendency) and 6 (slip tendency + dilation tendency). Shmin varies from northwest to east‐west trending throughout much of the Great Basin. As such, north‐ to northeast‐striking faults have the highest tendency to slip and to dilate, depending on the local trend of shmin. These results provide a first order filter on faults and fault systems in the Great Basin, affording focusing of local‐scale exploration efforts for blind or hidden geothermal resources.\n",

      "description": "Independent Technical Report: Geothermal Resource at the McGee Mountain Prospect, Humboldt County, Nevada\n\nGeothermEx, Inc.\nRichmond, California, USA\n1 JULY 2010\n\nThis report describes the geothermal resource at McGee Mountain, including:\n 1. Local geology\n2. Thermal features\n3. Known bore holes and temperature gradients\n4. Geophysical surveys\n5. Fluid geochemistry and geothermometry\n6. Estimate of the heat-in-place\n\nDescription of the heat-in-place estimate:\nThe magnitude of the geothermal resource at McGee Mountain (Painted Hills) has been estimated using a Monte Carlo method applied to estimating heat-in-place. The method relies (along with certain other parameters) on estimates of the area, thickness and average temperature of the resource, but among these, only area has some constraint at this time. Therefore, the estimates used for thickness and temperature have been based on the characteristics of other\ngeothermal resources in Nevada.\n\nResults yield a 90%-probable (“P90”) thermal energy-in-place estimate of 87,300 MWth-years (that is, 90% of estimates are higher). We consider this to be a “minimum” likely value. At 50% probability (“P50”) the estimate is 134,000 MWth-years. The recoverable portion of the preceding estimate of energy-in-place has also been estimated and converted into electrical energy, using values of recovery factor, rejection temperature, utilization factor, plant capacity factor and power plant life that are provided. The minimum (90% probable) estimate for generation potential is about 25 MWe for 30 years (or a total of 750 MWe-years) and at 50% probability the estimate is 52 MWe for 30 years (or a total of 1,560 MWe-years). These estimates are somewhat larger than a public-domain McGee resource estimate made by GeothermEx in 2004, because a 2-m deep temperature survey by Caldera has established continuance of the thermal anomaly about ½ mile further north than previously documented.\n\nThis resource estimate was made without reference to the Caldera property (project area) boundary, but it is likely that the entire magnitude of estimated resource lies within it. The estimate should be regarded with caution because there needs to be subsequent proof of area, thickness, temperature and commercial permeability by means of deep drilling and testing. No heat-in-place estimate of this type should ever be used to determine the final, installed size of a well field and power plant.\n",

      "description": "Effectiveness of shallow temperature surveys to target a geothermal reservoir at previously explored site at McGee Mountain, Nevada\n\nFinal Report for U.S. Department Of Energy Grant EE-0002830\n\nThe McGee Mountain geothermal area was selected for funding under U.S. Department of Energy Grant DE-FOA-0002830 to test early-stage shallow temperature survey techniques and drill two slim holes to test the resource. Geothermal Technical Partners, Inc., the recipient of the grant, was able to complete only a small portion of the project before lack of funding prevented further exploration work. This work included a shallow (2-meter) temperature survey, a Geoprobe survey, a close-spaced gravity survey, and several reports on geologic and transmission viability.\n\nThe 18-page report includes a description of the geothermal geology of the area, geochemistry and geothermometry of nearby springs and wells, and findings from the shallow temperature survey, Geoprobe survey, close-spaced gravity survey, heat-in-place estimate, transmission viability, and an archeological survey. The report makes the following conclusions:\n\nBesides further exploring the resource at McGee Mountain, the project did fulfill at least some of its original goals of assessing the effectiveness of the two shallow temperature survey techniques. This assessment was augmented somewhat by including 2-meter and Geoprobe surveys at two other geothermal sites in Nevada. Some of the conclusions reached are as follows:\n•\tBoth the shallow 2-meter and the Geoprobe surveys are cost-effective methods to detect subsurface thermal anomalies in early-stage exploration, prior to more expensive temperature gradient drilling.\n•\tThe major advantages of the 2-meter survey are its extreme portability (no roads needed), cost per site measurement, and low environmental impact.\n•\tThe 2-meter survey’s disadvantages are its inability to penetrate hard substrates and the noise effects due to solar heating of the ground.\n•\tThe Geoprobe’s advantages are its ability to collect temperature and uncontaminated water samples, greater depth of penetration (to 60m), relatively low cost, and low environmental impact.\n•\tThe Geoprobe’s disadvantages are its inability to go off-road or to penetrate hard substrates.\n•\tCosts to perform both types of surveys are low, together less than the cost of one conventional temperature gradient well. Given the potential increase in data that these surveys can provide, this is extreme value for the exploration dollar.\n",

Project HOTSPOT has coordinated international institutions and organizations to understand subsurface stratigraphy and assess geothermal potential. Over 5.9km of core were drilled from three boreholes within the SRP in an attempt to acquire continuous core documenting the volcanic and sedimentary record of the hotspot: (1) Kimama, (2) Kimberly, and (3) Mountain Home. The Kimama drill site was set up to acquire a continuous\nrecord of basaltic volcanism along the central volcanic axis and to test the extent of geothermal resources beneath the Snake River aquifer.\nData submitted by project collaborator Doug Schmitt, University of Alberta",

Project HOTSPOT has coordinated international institutions and organizations to understand subsurface stratigraphy and assess geothermal potential. Over 5.9km of core were drilled from three boreholes within the SRP in an attempt to acquire continuous core documenting the volcanic and sedimentary record of the hotspot: (1) Kimama, (2) Kimberly, and (3) Mountain Home. The Mountain Home drill hole is located along the western plain and documents older basalts overlain by sediment. \nData submitted by project collaborator Doug Schmitt, University of Alberta",

      "description": "The Snake River Plain (SRP), Idaho, hosts potential geothermal resources due to elevated groundwater temperatures associated with the thermal anomaly Yellowstone-Snake River hotspot. Project HOTSPOT has coordinated international institutions and organizations to understand subsurface stratigraphy and assess geothermal potential. Over 5.9km of core were drilled from three boreholes within the SRP in an attempt to acquire continuous core documenting the volcanic and sedimentary record of the hotspot: (1) Kimama, (2) Kimberly, and (3) Mountain Home. The Kimberly drill hole was selected to document continuous volcanism when analysed in conjunction with the Kimama and is located near the margin of the plain.\nData submitted by project collaborator Doug Schmitt, University of Alberta",

Project HOTSPOT has coordinated international institutions and organizations to understand subsurface stratigraphy and assess geothermal potential. Over 5.9km of core were drilled from three boreholes within the SRP in an attempt to acquire continuous core documenting the volcanic and sedimentary record of the hotspot: (1) Kimama, (2) Kimberly, and (3) Mountain Home. The Kimberly drill hole was selected to document continuous volcanism when analysed in conjunction with the Kimama and is located near the margin of the plain.\nData submitted by project collaborator Doug Schmitt, University of Alberta",

      "description": "Data generated from the Silver Peak Innovative Exploration Project, in Esmeralda County, Nevada, encompasses a “deep-circulation (amagmatic)” meteoric-geothermal system circulating beneath basin-fill sediments locally blanketed with travertine in western Clayton Valley (lithium-rich brines from which have been mined for several decades). Spring- and shallow-borehole thermal-water geochemistry and geothermometry suggest that a Silver Peak geothermal reservoir is very likely to attain the temperature range 260- 300oF (~125-150oC), and may reach 300-340oF (~150-170oC) or higher (GeothermEx, Inc., 2006). Results of detailed geologic mapping, structural analysis, and conceptual modeling of the prospect (1) support the GeothermEx (op. cit.) assertion that the Silver Peak prospect has good potential for geothermal-power production; and (2) provide a theoretical geologic framework for further exploration and development of the resource.\n\nThe Silver Peak prospect is situated in the transtensional (regional shearing coupled with extension) Walker Lane structural belt, and squarely within the late Miocene to Pliocene (11 Ma to ~5 Ma) Silver Peak-Lone Mountain metamorphic core complex (SPCC), a feature that accommodated initial displacement transfer between major right-lateral strike- slip fault zones on opposite sides of the Walker Lane. The SPCC consists essentially of a ductiley-deformed lower plate, or “core,” of Proterozoic metamorphic tectonites and tectonized Mesozoic granitoids separated by a regionally extensive, low-angle detachment fault from an upper plate of severely stretched and fractured structural slices of brittle, Proterozoic to Miocene-age lithologies. From a geothermal perspective, the detachment fault itself and some of the upper-plate structural sheets could function as important, if secondary, subhorizontal thermal-fluid aquifers in a Silver Peak hydrothermal system.",

The geothermal system at Alum is wholly concealed; its upper reaches discovered in the late 1970s during a regional thermal-gradient drilling campaign. The prospect boasts several shallow thermal-gradient (TG) boreholes with TG >75oC/km (and as high as 440oC/km) over 200-m intervals in the depth range 0-600 m. Possibly boiling water encountered at 239 m depth in one of these boreholes returned chemical- geothermometry values in the range 150-230oC. GeothermEx (2008) has estimated the electrical- generation capacity of the current Alum leasehold at 33 megawatts for 20 years; and the corresponding value for the broader thermal anomaly extending beyond the property at 73 megawatts for the same duration.",

      "description": "The Newberry Volcano EGS Demonstration in central Oregon, a 3 year project begun in 2010, tests recent technological advances designed to reduce the cost of power generated by EGS in a hot, dry well (NWG 55-29) drilled in 2008. First, the stimulation pumps used were designed to run for weeks and deliver large volumes of water at moderate well-head pressure. Second, to stimulate multiple zones, AltaRock developed thermo-degradable zonal isolation materials (TZIMs) to seal off fractures in a geothermal well to stimulate secondary and tertiary fracture zones. The TZIMs degrade within weeks, resulting in an optimized injection/ production profile of the entire well. Third, the project followed a project-specific Induced Seismicity Mitigation Plan (ISMP) to evaluate, monitor for, and mitigate felt induced seismicity. Stimulation started October 17, 2012 and continued for 7 weeks, with over 41,000 m3 of water injected. Two TZIM treatments successfully shifted the depth of stimulation. Injectivity, DTS, and seismic analysis indicate that fracture permeability in well NWG 55-29 was enhanced by two orders of magnitude.",

The objective of the research is to expand the \"tool box\" available to the geothermal driller by furthering the development of a high-temperature drilling motor that can be used in directional drilling applications for drilling high temperature geothermal formations.  The motor is specifically designed to operate in conjunction with a pneumatic down-the-hole-hammer.  It provides a more compact design compared to traditional drilling motors such as PDMs (positive displacement motors).  The packaging can help to enhance directional drilling capabilities.  It uses no elastomeric components, which enables it to operate in higher temperatures ( >250 °F). Current work on the motor has shown that is a capable of operating under pneumatic power with a down-the-hole-hammer.  Further development work will include continued testing and refining motor components and evaluating motor capabilities.\n\nTargets/Milestones\nComplete testing current motor - 12/31/2010\nMake final material and design decisions - 01/31/2011\nBuild and test final prototype - 04/31/2011\nFinal demonstration - 07/31/2011\nImpacts\nThe development of the motor will help to achieve program technical objectives by improving well construction capabilities.  This includes enabling high-temperature drilling as well as enhancing directional drilling.\n\nA key component in the auto indexer is the drive motor.  It is an air-driven vane motor that converts the energy stored in the compressed air to mechanical energy.  The motor is attached to hammer-like components which impart an impulsive load onto the drive shaft.  The impulsive force on the drive shaft in turn creates an indexing action.\n\nA controlled test was performed to characterize the performance of the the vane motor for a given pressure.  The Sandia dynamometer test station was used to determine the performance of the motor for a given input pressure.",

      "description": "Numerical simulations have shown that the use of supercritical CO2 instead of water as a heat transfer fluid yields significantly greater heat extraction rates for geothermal energy. If this technology is implemented successfully, it could increase geothermal energy production and offset atmospheric emissions of greenhouse gases. However, the impact of geochemical reactions between acidic waters in equilibrium with supercritical CO2 and the reservoir rock have not been evaluated. At issue are enhanced rock-water interactions that may reduce reservoir porosity and permeability and may exacerbate downstream scaling. Reactive transport simulations for CO2 sequestration in saline sandstone aquifers suggest that geochemistry plays a negligible role on reservoir integrity and storage capacity. Simulations show that mineral reactions are minimal, have negligible impact on permeability and porosity, and that a very small amount of CO2 is trapped as carbonate minerals. If dawsonite (sodium-aluminum-carbonate mineral) precipitates, as is predicted, experiments suggest that it will dissolve when the CO2 fluid is flushed out with CO2-poor water. Although the carbon sequestration literature suggests that geochemical reactions in geothermal reservoirs might also be minimal, temperatures in geothermal fluids are significantly higher (200 to 300°C) than deep saline reservoirs (below 100°). Higher temperatures and more acid waters yield much higher mineral dissolution rates and could impact reservoir integrity and downstream operations. Unfortunately it is not possible to predict the impact of CO2 within geothermal systems, because kinetic data at elevated temperatures is limited and simulations made with laboratory data alone will likely underestimate the geochemical impact on production of geothermal energy, because mineral precipitation from geothermal waters is much higher than it is in laboratory studies.\r\n\r\nObjectives\r\nAssess the geochemical impact of CO2 on geothermal energy production by analyzing the geochemistry of existing geothermal fields with elevated natural CO2, measuring realistic rock-water rates for geothermal systems using laboratory and field-based experiments, and developing reactive transport models using the filed-based rates to simulate production scale impacts.\r\n\r\nTargets/Milestones\r\nDetermine impact of CO2 on geochemistry of existing geothermal fields.\r\n\r\nLaboratory experiments to determine rock-water interactions in geothermal reservoirs for supercritical CO2 fluids.\r\n\r\nField experiments to further determine rock-water interactions for supercritical CO2 fluids.\r\n\r\nReactive-transport simulations to test that the use of supercritical CO2 will not be compromised by mineral dissolution and precipitation reactions.",

Roberts\r\nLawrence Livermore National Laboratory\r\nKeywords: Thermal spallation drilling, Numerical modeling, Engineered Geothermal Systems\r\nAbstract\r\nWells for Engineered Geothermal Systems (EGS) typically occur in conditions presenting significant challenges for conventional rotary and percussive drilling technologies: granitic rocks that reduce drilling speeds and cause substantial equipment wear. Thermal spallation drilling, in which rock is fragmented by high temperature rather than mechanical means, offers a potential solution to these problems. However, much of the knowledge surrounding this drilling technique is empirical - based on laboratory experiments that may or may not represent field conditions. There is a lack of understanding coupled with large uncertainties in the phenomenology of the process which could be resolved with computer modeling. System-scale simulations of thermal spallation employ phenomenological models of rock damage due to the thermal gradient and erosion of spalls by the fluid. This allows rapid evaluation of mass and energy balances near the drill head and parametric studies of the relationship between drilling performance and the parameters of the jet. However, large-scale modeling is not suitable for resolving rock grains and inhomogeneities, and the damage model\r\nmust account for the temperature gradient – not typically used as an input parameter in such material models. Thus, the parameters governing such phenomenological damage models require calibration by mesoscale simulations that\r\nfully resolve rock grains. This paper outlines a new numerical modeling effort investigating the grain-scale processes governing thermal spallation drilling. Several factors affect spall production at the mesoscale, including grain size and size distribution,\r\nsurface temperatures and material heterogeneity. To investigate the relative influence of these factors, we have conducted a series of simulations using GEODYN – a parallel Eulerian solid and fluid dynamics code. In this paper, we describe a two-dimensional model used to simulate the grain-scale processes and present preliminary results from this modeling effort.",

New drilling technologies are required to make geothermal power financially competitive with other energy sources. One potential solution is offered by Thermal Spallation Drilling (TSD) - a novel drilling technique in which small particles (spalls) are released from the rock surface by rapid heating. While TSD has the potential to improve drilling rates of brittle granitic rocks, the coupled thermomechanical processes involved in TSD are poorly described, making system control and optimization difficult for this drilling technology.\r\nIn this paper, we discuss results from a new modeling effort investigating thermal spallation drilling. In particular, we describe an explicit model that simulates the grain-scale mechanics of thermal spallation and use this model to examine existing theories concerning spalling mechanisms. We will report how borehole conditions influence spall production, and discuss implications for macro-scale models of drilling systems.\r\nThis work was performed under the auspices of the U.S. Department of Energy by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory under Contract DE-AC52-07NA27344.",

      "description": "Modeling Responses of Naturally Fractured Geothermal Reservoir to Low-Pressure Stimulation\r\nPengcheng Fu, Charles R. Carrigan\r\n\r\nAbstract:\r\nHydraulic shearing is an appealing reservoir stimulation strategy for Enhanced Geothermal Systems. It is believed that hydro-shearing is likely to simulate a fracture network that covers a relatively large volume of the reservoir whereas hydro-fracturing tends to create a small number of fractures. In this paper, we examine the geomechanical and hydraulic behaviors of natural fracture systems subjected to hydro-shearing stimulation and develop a coupled numerical model within the framework of discrete fracture network modeling. We found that in the low pressure hydro-shearing regime, the coupling between the fluid phase and the rock solid phase is relatively simple, and the numerical model is computationally efficient. Using this modified model, we study the behavior of a random fracture network subjected to hydro-shearing stimulation.\r\n",

      "description": "Investigation of Stimulation-Response Relationships for Complex Fracture Systems in Enhanced Geothermal Reservoirs\r\n\r\nFu, P., Johnson, S.M. and Carrigan, C.R.\r\nLawrence Livermore National Laboratory, Livermore, CA, U.S.A.\r\n\r\nABSTRACT: Hydraulic fracturing is currently the primary method for stimulating low-permeability geothermal reservoirs and creating Enhanced (or Engineered) Geothermal Systems (EGS) with improved permeability and heat production efficiency.  Complex natural fracture systems usually exist in the formations to be stimulated and it is therefore critical to understand the interactions between existing fractures and newly created fractures before optimal stimulation strategies can be developed.  Our study aims to improve the understanding of EGS stimulation-response relationships by developing and applying computer-based models that can effectively reflect the key mechanisms governing interactions between complex existing fracture networks and newly created hydraulic fractures.  In this paper, we first briefly describe the key modules of our methodology, namely a geomechanics solver, a discrete fracture flow solver, a rock joint response model, an adaptive remeshing module, and most importantly their effective coupling.  After verifying the numerical model against classical closed-form solutions, we investigate responses of reservoirs with different preexisting natural fractures to a variety of stimulation strategies.  The factors investigated include: the in situ stress states (orientation of the principal stresses and the degree of stress anisotropy), pumping pressure, and stimulation sequences of multiple wells.\r\n",

Carrigan\r\nThis paper documents our effort to use a fully coupled hydro-geomechanical numerical test bed to study using low hydraulic pressure to stimulate geothermal reservoirs with existing fracture network. In this low pressure stimulation strategy, fluid pressure is lower than the minimum in situ compressive stress, so the fractures are not completely open but permeability improvement can be achieved through shear dilation. The potential advantage of low pressure stimulation compared with high pressure stimulation is that a large fracture network instead of a single primary fracture can be stimulated. We found that in this low pressure regime, the coupling between the fluid phase and the rock solid phase becomes very simple, and the numerical model can achieve a low computational cost. Using this modified model, we study the behavior of a single fracture and a random fracture network.\r\n",

      "description": "The Snake River volcanic province (SRP) overlies a thermal anomaly that extends deep into the mantle; it represents one of the highest heat flow provinces in North America. The primary goal of this project is to evaluate geothermal potential in three distinct settings: (1) Kimama site: inferred high sub-aquifer geothermal gradient associated with the intrusion of mafic magmas, (2) Kimberly site: a valley-margin setting where surface heat flow may be driven by the up-flow of hot fluids along buried caldera ring-fault complexes, and (3) Mountain Home site: a more traditional fault-bounded basin with thick sedimentary cover. The Kimama hole, on the axial volcanic zone, penetrated 1912 m of basalt with minor intercalated sediment; no rhyolite basement was encountered. Temperatures are isothermal through the aquifer (to 960 m), then rise steeply on a super-conductive gradient to an estimated bottom hole temperature of ~98ºC. The Kimberly hole is on the inferred margin of a buried rhyolite eruptive center, penetrated rhyolite with intercalated basalt and sediment to a TD of 1958 m. Temperatures are isothermal at 55-60ºC below 400 m, suggesting an immense passive geothermal resource. The Mountain Home hole is located above the margin of a buried gravity high in the western SRP. It penetrates a thick section of basalt and lacustrine sediment overlying altered basalt flows, hyaloclastites, and volcanic sediments, with a TD of 1821 m. Artesian flow of geothermal water from 1745 m depth documents a power-grade resource that is now being explored in more detail. In-depth studies continue at all three sites, complemented by high-resolution gravity, magnetic, and seismic surveys, and by downhole geophysical logging. ",

      "description": "Exploring for Geothermal Resource in a Dormant Volcanic System: The\r\nHaleakala Southwest Rift Zone, Maui, Hawai’i\r\nB.A. Martini, J.L. Lewicki, B.M. Kennedy, C. Lide, G. Oppliger, P.S. Drakos\r\n\r\nSuites of new geophysical and geochemical surveys provide evidence for geothermal resource at the Haleakala Southwest Rift Zone (HSWRZ) on Maui\r\nIsland, Hawai’i. Ground-based gravity (~400 stations) coupled with heli-bourne magnetics (~1500 line kilometers) define both deep and shallow fractures/faults, while\r\nalso delineating potentially widespread subsurface hydrothermal alteration on the lower flanks (below approximately 1800 feet a.s.l.). Multi-level, upward continuation\r\ncalculations and 2-D gravity and magnetic modeling provide information on source depths, but lack of lithologic information leaves ambiguity in the estimates.\r\nLithology and physical property data from future drilling will improve these interpretations. Additionally, several well-defined gravity lows (possibly vent zones) lie\r\ncoincident with magnetic highs suggesting the presence of dike intrusions at depth; a potentially young source of heat for a modern geothermal system. Soil CO2\r\nfluxes were measured along transects across geophysically-defined faults and fractures as well as young cinder cones along the HSWRZ; a weak anomalous flux\r\nsignal was observed on one young cinder cone. Dissolved inorganic carbon concentrations and δ13C compositions and 3He/4He values measured in several shallow\r\ngroundwater samples indicate addition of magmatic CO2 and He to the groundwater system. The general lack of observed magmatic surface CO2 flux signals on the\r\nHSWRZ is is therefore likely due to a combination of groundwater “scrubbing” of CO2 and relatively high biogenic surface CO2 fluxes that mask potential magmatic\r\nsignals. Similar surveys at the Puna geothermal field on the Kilauea Lower East Rift Zone (KLERZ) also showed a lack of surface CO2 flux signals attributed to a\r\nmagmatic source, while aqueous geochemistry indicated contribution of magmatic CO2 and He to shallow groundwaters here. As magma has been intercepted in\r\ngeothermal drilling at the Puna field, the lack of measured surface CO2 flux indicative of upflow of magmatic fluids here is likely due to the aforementioned\r\n“scrubbing” by high groundwater flow and high background biogenic surface CO2 flux. Deep temperature gradient core holes will be cited on the HSWRZ based on geophysical and geochemical datasets.\r\n",

      "description": "This file contains a zipped file that contains many files required to run GEO2D. GEO2D is a computer code for simulating ground source heat pump (GSHP) systems in two-dimensions. GEO2D performs a detailed finite difference simulation of the heat transfer occurring within the working fluid, the tube wall, the grout, and the ground. Both horizontal and vertical wells can be simulated with this program, but it should be noted that the vertical wall is modeled as a single tube.  This program also models the heat pump in conjunction with the heat transfer occurring. GEO2D simulates the heat pump and ground loop as a system. Many results are produced by GEO2D as a function of time and position, such as heat transfer rates, temperatures and heat pump performance. On top of this information from an economic comparison between the geothermal system simulated and a comparable air heat pump systems or a comparable gas, oil or propane heating systems with a vapor compression air conditioner. The version of GEO2D in the attached file has been coupled to the DOE heating and cooling load software called ENERGYPLUS. This is a great convenience for the user because heating and cooling loads are an input to GEO2D. GEO2D is a user friendly program that uses a graphical user interface for inputs and outputs. These make entering data simple and they produce many plotted results that are easy to understand.  In order to run GEO2D access to MATLAB is required. If this program is not available on your computer you can download the program MCRInstaller.exe, the 64 bit version, from the MATLAB website or from this geothermal depository.  This is a free download which will enable you to run GEO2D..",

      "description": "Due the high temperature and pressure found in geothermal wells, tracer studies designed to elucidate properties of geothermal reservoirs are traditionally conducted by pulling liquid samples from the wellhead. These samples are then sent off for analysis in a fixed laboratory setting. Unfortunately by pulling the sample from the surface, information regarding the depth of the fractures generating the tracer flow is lost. Additionally, significant time is lost in sending the samples off for traditional chemical analysis. This talk will focus on our efforts to develop downhole high temperature and pressure stable ion selective electrodes capable of measuring the concentration of tracers used in geothermal studies, along with pH, at various depths in the wellbore creating tracer concentration and pH depth profiles for use in geothermal reservoir analysis.",

Accurate identification and mapping of the large numbers of microearthquakes induced in EGS is one technique that provides diagnostic information when determining the location, orientation and length of underground crack systems for use in reservoir development and management applications.  Conventional earthquake location techniques often are employed to locate microearthquakes.  However, these techniques require labor-intensive picking of individual seismic phase onsets across a network of sensors.  For this project we adapt the Matched Field Processing (MFP) technique to the elastic propagation problem in geothermal reservoirs to identify more and smaller events than traditional methods alone.",

      "description": "Background\nThe goal of this project was to create a template (and associated form) on OpenEI to solicit crowd-sourced information sharing about various geothermal resource areas around the world.  Over the past two years, twelve case studies have been researched by NREL staff testing the usability and content model developed.  The goal in FY14 is to encourage crowd-sourcing of information to populate information for more areas.\n\nThe data can be found here: http://en.openei.org/wiki/Geothermal_Areas \n\nOpenEI\nInformation about Geothermal Areas have been collected on OpenEI.  Some of the advantages of cataloging this information on OpenEI include:\n1. The ability to crowd-source information\n2. The ability to easily search for the information needed\n3. The ability to query information to compare various techniques\n4. The ability to link these data to other databases on OpenEI (for example, the NEPA database)\n\nGeothermal Area Properties\nProperties are searchable and queriable and can be used to compare various geothermal areas and their properties, either directly on OpenEI, or by export and manipulation in other programs, such as Excel.

      "description": "This report is a compilation of the work that has been done on the grant DE-EE0002805 entitled “Finite Volume Based Computer Program for Ground Source Heat Pump Systems.” The goal of this project was to develop a detailed computer simulation tool for GSHP (ground source heat pump) heating and cooling systems. Two such tools were developed as part of this DOE (Department of Energy) grant; the first is a two-dimensional computer program called GEO2D and the second is a three-dimensional computer program called GEO3D. Both of these simulation tools provide an extensive array of results to the user. A unique aspect of both these simulation tools is the complete temperature profile information calculated and presented. Complete temperature profiles throughout the ground, casing, tube wall, and fluid are provided as a function of time. The fluid temperatures from and to the heat pump, as a function of time, are also provided. In addition to temperature information, detailed heat rate information at several locations as a function of time is determined. Heat rates between the heat pump and the building indoor environment, between the working fluid and the heat pump, and between the working fluid and the ground are computed. The heat rates between the ground and the working fluid are calculated as a function time and position along the ground loop. The heating and cooling loads of the building being fitted with a GSHP are determined with the computer program developed by DOE called ENERGYPLUS. Lastly COP (coefficient of performance) results as a function of time are provided. Both the two-dimensional and three-dimensional computer programs developed as part of this work are based upon a detailed finite volume solution of the energy equation for the ground and ground loop. Real heat pump characteristics are entered into the program and used to model the heat pump performance. Thus these computer tools simulate the coupled performance of the ground loop and the heat pump. The price paid for the three-dimensional detail is the large computational times required with GEO3D. The computational times required for GEO2D are reasonable, a few minutes for a 20 year simulation. For a similar simulation, GEO3D takes days of computational time. Because of the small simulation times with GEO2D, a number of attractive features have been added to it. GEO2D has a user friendly interface where inputs and outputs are all handled with GUI (graphical user interface) screens. These GUI screens make the program exceptionally easy to use. To make the program even easier to use a number of standard input options for the most common GSHP situations are provided to the user. For the expert user, the option still exists to enter their own detailed information. To further help designers and GSHP customers make decisions about a GSHP heating and cooling system, cost estimates are made by the program. These cost estimates include a payback period graph to show the user where their GSHP system pays for itself. These GSHP simulation tools should be a benefit to the advancement of GSHP systems.",

      "description": "FULLY COUPLED GEOMECHANICS AND DISCRETE FLOW NETWORK MODELING OF HYDRAULIC FRACTURING FOR GEOTHERMAL APPLICATIONS \nby Pengcheng Fu, Scott M. Johnson, Yue Hao, and Charles R. Carrigan\nThe primary objective of our current research is to develop a computational test bed for evaluating borehole techniques to enhance fluid flow and heat transfer in enhanced geothermal systems (EGS). Simulating processes resulting in hydraulic fracturing and/or the remobilization of existing fractures, especially the interaction between propagating fractures and existing fractures, represents a critical goal of our project. To this end, we are continuing to develop a hydraulic fracturing simulation capability within the Livermore Distinct Element Code (LDEC), a combined FEM/DEM analysis code with explicit solid-fluid mechanics coupling. LDEC simulations start from an initial fracture distribution which can be stochastically generated or upscaled from the statistics of an actual fracture distribution. During the hydraulic stimulation process, LDEC tracks the propagation of fractures and other modifications to the fracture system. The output is transferred to the Non-isothermal Unsaturated Flow and Transport (NUFT) code to capture heat transfer and flow at the reservoir scale. This approach is intended to offer flexibility in the types of analyses we can perform, including evaluating the effects of different system heterogeneities on the heat extraction rate as well as seismicity associated with geothermal operations.  This paper details the basic methodology of our approach. Two numerical examples showing the capability and effectiveness of our simulator are also presented.",

Johnson, Yue Hao, and Charles R. Carrigan\nThe primary objective of our current research is to develop a computational test bed for evaluating borehole techniques to enhance fluid flow and heat transfer in enhanced geothermal systems (EGS). Simulating processes resulting in hydraulic fracturing and/or the remobilization of existing fractures, especially the interaction between propagating fractures and existing fractures, represents a critical goal of our project. To this end, we are continuing to develop a hydraulic fracturing simulation capability within the Livermore Distinct Element Code (LDEC), a combined FEM/DEM analysis code with explicit solid-fluid mechanics coupling. LDEC simulations start from an initial fracture distribution which can be stochastically generated or upscaled from the statistics of an actual fracture distribution. During the hydraulic stimulation process, LDEC tracks the propagation of fractures and other modifications to the fracture system. The output is transferred to the Non-isothermal Unsaturated Flow and Transport (NUFT) code to capture heat transfer and flow at the reservoir scale. This approach is intended to offer flexibility in the types of analyses we can perform, including evaluating the effects of different system heterogeneities on the heat extraction rate as well as seismicity associated with geothermal operations.  This paper details the basic methodology of our approach. Two numerical examples showing the capability and effectiveness of our simulator are also presented.",

      "description": "In enhanced geothermal systems (EGS) the reservoir permeability is often enhanced or created using hydraulic fracturing.  In hydraulic fracturing, high fluid pressures are applied to confined zones in the subsurface usually using packers to fracture the host rock.  This enhances rock permeability and therefore conductive heat transfer to the circulating geothermal fluid (e.g. water or supercritical carbon dioxide).  The ultimate goal is to increase or improve the thermal energy production from the subsurface by either optimal designs of injection and production wells or by altering the fracture permeability to create different zones of circulation that can be exploited in geothermal heat extraction.  Moreover, hydraulic fracturing can lead to the creation of undesirable short-circuits or fast flow-paths between the injection and extraction wells leading to a short thermal residence time, low heat recovery, and thus a short-life of the EGS. \n\nA potential remedy to these problems is to deploy a cementing (blocking, diverting) agent to minimize short-cuts and/or create new circulation cells for heat extraction.  A potential diverting agent is the colloidal silica by-product that can be co-produced from geothermal fluids.  Silica gels are abundant in various surface and subsurface applications, yet they have not been evaluated for EGS applications.  In this study we are investigating the benefits of silica gel deployment on thermal response of an EGS, either by blocking short-circuiting undesirable pathways as a result of diverting the geofluid to other fractures; or creating, within fractures, new circulation cells for harvesting heat through newly active surface area contact.  A significant advantage of colloidal silica is that it can be co-produced from geothermal fluids using an inexpensive membrane-based separation technology that was developed previously using DOE-GTP funding. \n\nThis co-produced silica has properties that potentially make it useful as a fluid diversion agent for subsurface applications.  Colloidal silica solutions exist as low-viscosity fluids during their “induction period” but then undergo a rapid increase in viscosity (gelation) to form a solid gel.  The length of the induction period can be manipulated by varying the properties of the solution, such as silica concentration and colloid size.  We believe it is possible to produce colloidal silica gels suitable for use as diverting agents for blocking undesirable fast-paths which result in short-circuiting the EGS once hydraulic fracturing has been deployed.   In addition, the gels could be used in conventional geothermal fields to increase overall energy recovery by modifying flow.",

Based on a set of relevant metrics, the method is aptly suited for comparing the environmental performance of competing products systems. This file contains LCA data and results for electric power production including geothermal power. The LCA for electric power has been broken down into two life cycle stages, namely plant and fuel cycles.  \n\nRelevant metrics include the energy ratio and greenhouse gas (GHG) ratios, where the former is the ratio of system input energy to total lifetime electrical energy out and the latter is the ratio of the sum of all incurred greenhouse gases (in CO2 equivalents) divided by the same energy output. \n\nSpecific information included herein are material to power (MPR) ratios for a range of power technologies for conventional thermoelectric, renewables (including three geothermal power technologies), and coproduced natural gas/geothermal power. For the geothermal power scenarios, the MPRs include the casing, cement, diesel, and water requirements for drilling wells and topside piping.\n\nAlso included herein are energy and GHG ratios for plant and fuel cycle stages for the range of considered electricity generating technologies. \n\nSome of this information are MPR data extracted directly from the literature or from models (eg. ICARUS – a subset of ASPEN models) and others (energy and GHG ratios) are results calculated using GREET models and MPR data. MPR data for wells included herein were based on the Argonne well materials model and GETEM well count results.\n",

      "description": "The Engineered Geothermal System (EGS) Exploration Methodology Project is developing an exploration approach for EGS through the integration of geoscientific data.  The Project chose the Dixie Valley Geothermal System in Nevada as a field laboratory site for methodlogy calibration purposes because, in the public domain, it is a highly characterized geothermal systems in the Basin and Range with a considerable amount of geoscience and most importantly, well data.  This Baseline Conceptual Model report summarizes the results of the first three project tasks (1) collect and assess the existing public domain geoscience data, (2) design and populate a GIS database, and (3) develop a baseline (existing data) geothermal conceptual model, evaluate geostatistical relationships, and generate baseline, coupled EGS favorability/trust maps from +1km above sea level (asl) to -4km asl for the Calibration Area (Dixie Valley Geothermal Wellfield) to identify EGS drilling targets at a scale of 5km x 5km.  It presents (1) an assessment of the readily available public domain data and some proprietary data provided by Terra-Gen Power, LLC, (2) a re-interpretation of these data as required, (3) an exploratory geostatistical data analysis, (4) the baseline geothermal conceptual model, and (5) the EGS favorability/trust mapping.  The conceptual model presented applies to both the hydrothermal system and EGS in the Dixie Valley region. ",

      "description": "Effective enhanced geothermal systems (EGS) require optimal fracture networks for efficient heat transfer between hot rock and fluid. Microseismic mapping is a key tool used to infer the subsurface fracture geometry. Traditional earthquake detection and location techniques are often employed to identify microearthquakes in geothermal regions. However, most commonly used algorithms may miss events if the seismic signal of an earthquake is small relative to the background noise level or if a microearthquake occurs within the coda of a larger event. Consequently, we have developed a set of algorithms that provide improved microearthquake detection. Our objective is to investigate the microseismicity at the DOE Newberry EGS site to better image the active regions of the underground fracture network during and immediately after the EGS stimulation. Detection of more microearthquakes during EGS stimulations will allow for better seismic delineation of the active regions of the underground fracture system. This improved knowledge of the reservoir network will improve our understanding of subsurface conditions, and allow improvement of the stimulation strategy that will optimize heat extraction and maximize economic return.",

      "description": "NREL's Geographic Information System (GIS) team offers both a national wind resource assessment of the United States and high-resolution wind data. The national wind resource assessment was created for the U.S. Department of Energy in 1986 by the Pacific Northwest Laboratory and is documented in the Wind Energy Resource Atlas of the United States, October 1986. This national wind resource data provides an estimate of the annual average wind resource for the conterminous United States, with a resolution of 1 3 degree of latitude by 1 4 degree of longitude.    The wind resource assessment was based on surface wind data, coastal marine area data, and upper-air data, where applicable. In data-sparse areas, three qualitative indicators of wind speed or power were used when applicable: topographic meteorological indicators (e.g. gorges, mountain summits, sheltered valleys); wind deformed vegetation; and eolian landforms (e.g. playas, sand dunes). The data was evaluated at a regional level to produce 12 regional wind resource assessments; the regional assessments were then incorporated into the national wind resource assessment.    The conterminous United States was divided into grid cells 1 4 degree of latitude by 1 3 degree of longitude. Each grid cell was assigned a wind power class ranging from 1 to 6, with 6 being the windiest. The wind power density limits for each wind power class are shown in Table 1-1. Each grid cell contains sites of varying power class. The assigned wind power class is representative of the range of wind power densities likely to occur at exposed sites within the grid cell. Hilltops, ridge crests, mountain summits, large clearings, and other locations free of local obstruction to the wind will be well exposed to the wind. In contrast, locations in narrow valleys and canyons, downwind of hills or obstructions, or in forested or urban areas are likely to have poor wind exposure.",

      "title": "The Open PV Project",
      "description": "Open PV Project is a collaborative effort between government, industry, and public that is compiling a comprehensive database of photovoltaic (PV) installation data for the U.S. Data for the project are voluntarily contributed from a variety of sources including utilities, installers, and general public. Data collected is maintained by contributors and are always changing to provide an evolving, up-to-date snapshot of the U.S. solar power market. Data Collection. Open PV Project is collecting data from any willing contributor of available info. NREL has seeded Open PV database by requesting data from most state run incentive programs, large utilities, and other organizations. This initial data collection provided a solid base of data for the project to launch from and it is our hope that the database will continue to grow through contributions from the PV community and anyone interested in understanding PV market dynamics in U.S.  Data Quality. Determining the quality of incoming data is dependent upon who is submitting the data to the project. This means that data coming from users associated with a particular organization may be trusted more than data from other unknown users. Each registered user is assigned a default score based on the organizational affiliation. This score is highest for Gov't users (State, Federal, etc.) because such users are often involved with incentive programs that have a defined data collection process in place. Second are utility and PV installers (and others in the PV industry), etc. Users who contribute data to the project can gain a project reputation that can impact the score of the data they contribute. Validation. Data validation occurs on each record in the database regularly. The database is continually analyzed for corrupt records, bad or invalid data, and outliers such as an abnormal cost to watt ratio. Records found to contain questionable data are flagged and dealt with on a case by case basis by a member of Open PV Team. Duplication. Understanding duplication is one of the ways that individual records are validated. In a publicly contributed database, it is imperative to anticipate the submission of duplicate records. When duplicate records are detected, they are added to an install specific list of duplicates and the data provided are aggregated into summary records of their respective installs. Identifying duplicate records helps validate PV installs in the database. The more a PV installation is duplicated in the database, the more trust the project places on the data for that installation. Data Fields. Required Fields. Open PV Project is designed to store nearly any type of info pertaining to PV installations. To provide the primary statistics from the database we have identified 4 data fields that are required of each PV install added to the project. These 4 fields are:  Date Installed (Completion date or interconnection date)-Size Capacity of the PV Installation (in kW DC)-Location (Zipcode or Street Address)-Total Installed Cost (in USD, before incentives). Additional Fields. These 4 required fields provide Open PV Project with the base info needed to derive several key statistics on the U.S. PV market, including historical trends and regional comparisons. However, the design of Open PV database is capable of storing nearly any type of data associated with PV installation, so Open PV Team  encourages you to contribute additional info you are comfortable sharing. This info can be extremely valuable, e.g., data that contains info about who installed the PV installation can help answer very useful questions about where certain installers are working. Info on module or inverter types can be useful in mapping efficiency, and detailed financing info can be a key factor in understanding trends in overall installation cost. Open PV Team encourages the contribution of data you feel comfortable providing, especially data you would like to see visualized in our gallery.",

Resolution varies spatially from 1 km to 1 degree (approximately 100 km) depending on the data source.  High spatial resolution datasets (1 km to 40 km cells) were modeled to support country or regional projects.  Where high resolution datasets were not available, data from NASA’s Surface Meteorology and Solar Energy (SSE) version 6 database were used.  \r\n\r\nThe data represent total potential solar energy per year as a function of land area per solar class (`KWh/m²/day`).  Each solar class correlates to a specific `0.5 kWh/m²/day` range.  Energy is calculated by multiplying the productive land by the class, conversion efficiency and number of days per year.  In this case, a standard calendar year of 365 days was used.  The conversion efficiency rate applied was 10%.\r\n\r\n`E = Productive Land * kWh/m²/day * 365 days * 10% efficiency`\r\n\r\nThe solar data has been derived from solar data measured or modeled between 1961  and 2008, depending on the dataset.",

Solar radiation is modeled using the [NREL](http://en.openei.org/wiki/NREL) METSTAT model, with surface observed cloud cover being the principal model input. Each container file contains up to 30 yearly files for one station, plus the Typical Meteorological Year (TMY) file for the selected station, plus documentation files and a TMY data reader file for use with Microsoft Excel.\r\n\r\n_(Purpose):_ Simulations\r\n\r\n_(Supplemental Information):_ The intended use of these data files is for computer simulations of solar energy conversion systems and building systems. The yearly data may be suitable for designing systems and their components to meet the worst-case conditions occurring at a location, if enough years of data are present. The TMY consists of months selected from individual years and concatenated to form a complete year.. Because of the selection criteria, these TMYs are not appropriate for simulations of wind energy conversion systems. A TMY provides a standard for hourly data for solar radiation and other meteorological elements that permit performance comparisons of system types and configurations for one or more locations. A TMY is not necessarily a good indicator of conditions over the next year, or even the next 5 years. Rather, it represents conditions judged to be typical over a long period of time, such as 30 years.",

The 2005 survey collected data from 4,381 households in housing units statistically selected to represent the 111.1 million housing units in the U.S. Data were obtained from residential energy suppliers for each unit in the sample to produce the Consumption & Expenditures data. The Consumption & Expenditures and Intensities data is divided into two parts: Part 1 provides energy consumption and expenditures by census region, population density, climate zone, type of housing unit, year of construction and ownership status; Part 2 provides the same data according to household size, income category, race and age. The next update to the RECS survey (2009 data) will be available in 2011.",

      "description": "This dataset was developed by NREL's distributed energy systems integration group as part of a study on high penetrations of distributed solar PV [1]. It consists of hourly load data in CSV format for use with the PNNL taxonomy of distribution feeders [2].  These feeders were developed in the open source GridLAB-D modelling language [3].  In this dataset each of the load points in the taxonomy feeders is populated with hourly averaged load data from a utility in the feeder’s geographical region, scaled and randomized to emulate real load profiles.  For more information on the scaling and randomization process, see [1]. \r\n\r\nThe taxonomy feeders are statistically representative of the various types of distribution feeders found in five geographical regions of the U.S.  Efforts are underway (possibly complete) to translate these feeders into the OpenDSS modelling language. \r\n\r\nThis data set consists of one large CSV file for each feeder.  Within each CSV, each column represents one load bus on the feeder.  The header row lists the name of the load bus.  The subsequent 8760 rows represent the loads for each hour of the year.  The loads were scaled and randomized using a Python script, so each load series represents only one of many possible randomizations.  In the header row, \"rl\" = residential load and \"cl\" = commercial load.  Commercial loads are followed by a phase letter (A, B, or C).  For regions 1-3, the data is from 2009.  For regions 4-5, the data is from 2000.\r\n\r\nFor use in GridLAB-D, each column will need to be separated into its own CSV file without a header.  The load value goes in the second column, and corresponding datetime values go in the first column, as shown in the sample file, sample_individual_load_file.csv.  Only the first value in the time column needs to written as an absolute time; subsequent times may be written in relative format (i.e. \"+1h\", as in the sample).  The load should be written in P+Qj format, as seen in the sample CSV, in units of Watts (W) and Volt-amps reactive (VAr).  This dataset was derived from metered load data and hence includes only real power; reactive power can be generated by assuming an appropriate power factor.  These loads were used with GridLAB-D version 2.2.\r\n\r\n[Browse files](http://en.openei.org/datasets/files/968/pub/) in this dataset, accessible as individual files and as a single ZIP file.

A user facility is a federally sponsored research facility available for external use to advance scientific or technical knowledge under the following conditions:      - The facility is open to all interested potential users without regard to nationality or institutional affiliation.    - Allocation of facility resources is determined by merit review of the proposed work.    - User fees are not charged for non-proprietary work if the user intends to publish the research results in the open literature. Full cost recovery is required for proprietary work.    - The facility provides resources sufficient for users to conduct work safely and efficiently.    - The facility supports a formal user organization to represent the users and facilitate sharing of information, forming collaborations, and organizing research efforts among users.    - The facility capability does not compete with an available private sector capability.",

      "description": "This phase of the project began with the development of a geodatabase with the focus predominantly on Ethanol. The task involved collection of data on ethanol production locations, transportation networks, production and storage capacities, transloading and blending locations and geographic marketing areas. The data were obtained by contacting the authorized person(s) in the ethanol plants. The plant contact information was gathered from the related websites, the exact physical location of the plant was verified, the production and storage capacity at the location, the mode of transportation used to ship ethanol to the marketer and the loading capacity were also obtained from the source. The contact information of the person had also been recorded for future reference. The information obtained had been updated to the geodatabase. Few organizations have been reluctant to share information due to proprietary issues.\r\n\r\nThe second task in this phase was to obtain the closest latitude and longitude positions to the plant locations and transloading terminals in order to generate the shape files. This was accomplished using relevant websites available online [3] [4] [5]. The websites provided the latitude and longitude for the given address. The location was then verified using the satellite view. This was helpful in most cases as the satellite view showed the plant at the location. In few other cases the location was offset from the original position thereby giving an incorrect latitude and longitude. This was rectified by taking the exact latitude and longitude based on the satellite view. For those locations without a proper satellite view, an approximate position was taken. The latitude and longitude for the transloading locations were also obtained the similar way in most cases, the verification of the locations and collecting data on the storage capacity at these locations are under progress.\r\n\r\nThe third task began with the collection of geospatial data on biodiesel plants which is being progressed in a similar manner. The current focus is on biodiesel plants with a production capacity of more than 10mgy. This limit was set as most biodiesel plants with low production capacity were catering to a local market thus making it difficult to understand the distribution on a national level as the project is more focused on that aspect. \r\n\r\nREFERENCE:\r\n\r\nwww.ethanolrfa.org/industry/locations\r\n\r\nwww.ethanolproducer.com\r\n\r\nstevemorse.org/jcal/latlon.php\r\n\r\nitouchmap.com/latlong.html\r\n\r\nmapper.acme.com\r\n\r\nwww.biodiesel.org\r\n\r\nPrepared By Shani Mamunni",

Solar radiation is modeled using the NREL METSTAT model, with surface observed cloud cover being the principal model input. The container file contains one TMY file for each selected station in the region, plus documentation files and a TMY data reader file for use with Microsoft Excel.\r\n\r\n_(Purpose):_  Simulations\r\n\r\n_(Supplemental Information):_ A TMY consists of months selected from individual years and concatenated to form a complete year. The intended use is for computer simulations of solar energy conversion systems and building systems. Because of the selection criteria, these TMYs are not appropriate for simulations of wind energy conversion systems. A TMY provides a standard for hourly data for solar radiation and other meteorological elements that permit performance comparisons of system types and configurations for one or more locations. A TMY is not necessarily a good indicator of conditions over the next year, or even the next 5 years. Rather, it represents conditions judged to be typical over a long period of time, such as 30 years. Because they represent typical rather than extreme conditions, they are not suited for designing systems and their components to meet the worst-case conditions occurring at a location.",

The SWERA application utilizes Geographical Information Systems (GIS) to develop common scenarios to evaluate potential locations for solar or wind energy plants.\r\n\r\n_(Supplemental Information):_ The zip file contains the available geospatial toolkit data and metadata. Each country's data package depends on the data provided by the SWERA partners.\r\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nThe GsT was completely redesigned and re-released in November 2010 to provide a more modern, easier-to-use interface with considerably faster analytical querying capabilities. The revised version of the Geospatial Toolkit for Sri Lanka is available using the following link:  http://www.nrel.gov/international/downloads/gst_srilanka.exe\r\n\r\n_NOTE:_ Please use the provided link to access the most up to date software package and data.  The Sri Lanka GsT data were last updated in January 2011.  The attached zip file below is an archive and contains the previous version of the geospatial toolkit executable that has been replaced.\r\n\r\nPlease visit [Geospatial Toolkit](http://en.openei.org/wiki/Geospatial_Toolkit) for additional information about the GsT and updates.",

      "description": "The Geospatial Toolkit (GsT) is a map viewer developed by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL). The toolkit helps energy planners, project developers, researchers and others identify areas of a country that show good potential for renewable energy projects. The toolkit displays renewable energy data along with information about the geography, location of population centers, borders, and transportation and power infrastructure.\r\n<br><br>\r\nThe toolkit is integrated with HOMER, a power system simulation and optimization model, originally developed at NREL and currently owned by HOMER Energy LLC. HOMER integration with the toolkit makes it possible to automatically populate HOMER inputs using weather data from the toolkit to help you get started with your HOMER analysis.

      "description": "_(Abstract):_  Stand–alone and easy to use geographic toolkit that allows non-GIS users to relate the renewable energy resource (solar and wind) data to other geographic data, such as land use, protected areas, elevation, etc.\r\n\r\n_(Purpose):_  The Solar and Wind Energy Resource Assessment (SWERA) Geospatial Toolkit (GsT) is a map-based software application that can be used for decision making and policy analysis in addition to planning for future energy projects. The SWERA application utilizes Geographical Information Systems (GIS) to develop common scenarios to evaluate potential locations for solar or wind energy plants.\r\n\r\n_(Supplemental Information):_ Enhancements to the GeoSpatial Toolkit (GsT) were funded by USAID's Southeast Asia Regional Initiative/Energy (SARI/E).  These enhancements include additional functionality and data development not available with the standard GeoSpatial Toolkit.\r\n\r\nFunctionality\r\n---------------------------\r\nThe additional functionality that has been added is a link from the GsT to the HOMER application, which provides analysis on system optimization.  The user will select a point on the map by clicking on it with a HOMER tool.  The tool will gather information on the wind, solar (global horizontal), elevation, and location to send to HOMER for analysis.  The tool will accept some user inputs and display a summary of the analysis results.  The user also has the option of opening the completed analysis directly in the HOMER application for additional options (using the \"Open HOMER File\" button).  Hydro data (if available) can be displayed in the tool window, but is not used by HOMER in its system optimization at this point.\r\nWhen the GsT is installed, it will also install the separate HOMER application with a 6 month license. After 6 months, the HOMER license will expire and the separate HOMER application will no longer run analyses.  THE LICENSE EXPIRATION WILL ONLY IMPACT THE \"Open HOMER File\" FUNCTIONALITY. The GsT will continue to run as usual and the \"Start HOMER\" button will continue to work.  However, when you click the \"Open HOMER File\" button, HOMER will only open files for \r\nviewing - you will no longer be able to make the HOMER application run an analysis.\r\nThe HOMER license can be renewed for free over the \r\ninternet.  You can renew your HOMER license and find out more about HOMER at this web address:\r\nhttp://www.nrel.gov/homer\r\n\r\nAdditional Data Development\r\n---------------------------\r\nMonthly Wind Resource Data:  The existing annual wind resource dataset has been expanded to include average wind speed and power for each month, annual average Weibull K shape parameter, annual average autocorrelation coefficient, and the annual diurnal pattern, peak hour, and pattern strength.  These parameters are needed for HOMER to synthesize an hourly wind speed for a representative year (8760 hours).\r\n\r\nHydro Resource Data:  A hydro resource dataset was developed as a separate task for SARI/E, and the results of that assessment have been incorporated for display within the GsT.  The hydro resource assessment provides annual and monthly estimates of average potential hydro power (kW).  The data was developed focusing on small hydro systems with small diversion distances, returning water to the stream within 200 m of the diversion point.\r\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nThe GsT was completely redesigned and re-released in November 2010 to provide a more modern, easier-to-use interface with considerably faster analytical querying capabilities.

      "description": "Technical Reference for Hydrogen Compatibility of Materials\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nGuidance on materials selection for hydrogen service is needed to support the deployment of hydrogen as a fuel as well as the development of codes and standards for stationary hydrogen use, hydrogen vehicles, refueling stations, and hydrogen transportation. Materials property measurement is needed on deformation, fracture and fatigue of metals in environments relevant to this hydrogen economy infrastructure. The identification of hydrogen-affected material properties such as strength, fracture resistance and fatigue resistance are high priorities to ensure the safe design of load-bearing structures.\r\n\r\nTo support the needs of the hydrogen community, Sandia National Laboratories (\"Sandia\") is conducting an extensive review of reports and journal publications to gather existing materials data for inclusion in the *Technical Reference for Hydrogen Compatibility of Materials*. Additionally, Sandia is working internationally with collaborators to acquire newly generated data for inclusion in the Technical Reference. **SAND2012-7321** is an archival report issued by Sandia National Laboratories representing the reference information compiled as of September 2012. Updates and additions of individual sections of this report are available at http://www.sandia.gov/matlsTechRef .\r\n\r\n### Technical Database for Hydrogen Compatibility of Materials\r\nThe Technical Database for Hydrogen Compatibility of Materials is intended to be a complement to the Technical Reference for Hydrogen Compatibility of Materials. Although still in the development stage, the Technical Database will provide a repository of technical data measured in hydrogen and is meant to be an engineering tool to aid the selection of materials for use in hydrogen.\r\n\r\nThe structure of the Technical Database will mirror the Technical Reference, using the same designations and classifications of materials. Below are some examples of the database information that is being compiled in the form of spreadsheets. A single material from a single study is represented in each spreadsheet: the material is indicated by the first four digits; the author and year are represented by the following characters; and the type of data follows (i.e. tensile, fracture and/or fatigue).\r\n\r\n#### Plain Carbon Ferritic Steels\r\n\r\n- 1100_CIA85_ten_fra_fat.xlsx\r\n- 1100_SAN10_fra_fat.xlsx\r\n- 1100_SAN10B_fra_fat.xlsx\r\n- 1100_SAN11_fra_fat.xlsx\r\n- 1100_SAN11B_fra_fat.xlsx\r\n\r\n#### Low-Alloy Ferritic Steels\r\n\r\n- 1211_NIB10_fra_fat.xlsx\r\n- 1211_SAN11_fat.xlsx \r\n\r\n#### Aluminum Alloys\r\n\r\n- 3230_SAN11_far_fat.xlsx\r\n\r\n*Financial support for the Technical Reference and the Technical Database is provided by the Safety, Codes and Standards program element of the Hydrogen and Fuel Cells Program, Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, United States Department of Energy.*\r\n",

      "title": "Global CFDDA-based Onshore and Offshore Wind Potential Supply Curves by Country, Class, and Depth (quantities in GW and PWh)",
      "description": "This dataset contains global onshore and offshore wind supply curves based on a resource assessment performed at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) based on the National Center for Atmospheric Research's (NCAR) Climate Four Dimensional Data Assimilation (CFDDA) mesoscale climate database. This overview is intended to provide a brief description of the origin of the tables in this workbook, not to fully explain the assumptions and calculations involved. A forthcoming paper will include full detail of sources and assumptions.\r\n\r\nThe supply curves are defined by country and resource quality. Onshore supply curves are further differentiated by distance to nearest large load or power plant, and offshore by distance to shore and water depth.\r\n\r\nThe CFDDA database contains hourly wind velocity vectors at a 40km grid, at multiple heights above ground level. For each grid cell, we create hourly wind speed distributions at 90m hub heights, and we compute gross capacity factor through convolution with a representative power curve. Output is derated for outages and wake losses to obtain net capacity factor. Onshore, we assumed a composite IEC Class II turbine; offshore, an IEC Class I turbine. We assumed a wind turbine density of 5 MW/km².\r\nLand and sea area are characterized by country (or country-like object, e.g, Alaska), land use/land cover, elevation, and protection status. Protected, urban, and high-elevation areas are fully excluded, and certain land cover types are fractionally excluded. Offshore, area within 5 nautical miles of or farther than 100 nautical miles from shore are excluded, as are protected marine areas. Marine areas are assigned to country based on exclusive economic zones; unassigned or disputed areas are excluded.\r\nAs alluded to previously, in this workbook, \"United States of America\" refers only to the continental U.S. Alaska and Hawaii are counted separately because of their remoteness. Unassigned \"countries\" comprise relatively remote, unpopulated areas (Alaska, Greenland, remote islands); and disputed marine areas. We recommend that their resource remain unassigned rather than grouped into larger IAM regions. \r\n\r\nThis product is a set of tables containing GW or PWh of technical wind resource potential, by net capacity factor, binned by distance to load/shore and water depth (for offshore). The power and energy quantities are computed independently, each from individual grid cells, so there is not a direct capacity-factor conversion between the two. We have not made assumptions about social or political pressures beyond the exclusion of protected areas, urban areas, and the land use/land cover exclusions introduced above. We have also tried to stay upstream of questions about the economic viability of wind development: i.e., the supply curves are independent of wind turbine cost. We leave the questions of economics to the models.\r\n\r\nAt the right of each table are columns of total and available land (or sea) area by country. Available area is area remaining for wind development after all geospatial exclusions are applied. \r\n",

Beginning in 2008, \r\nthe EIA-923 superseded the EIA-906, EIA-920, FERC 423, and the EIA-423. \r\n Schedule 2 of the EIA-923 collects the plant level fuel receipts and \r\ncost data previously collected on the FERC and EIA Forms 423. Data for \r\nfuel receipts and costs prior to 2010 are published at <a href=\"http://www.eia.doe.gov/cneaf/electricity/page/eia423.html\">/cneaf/electricity/page/eia423.html</a>.</p>\r\n          <p class=\"Bodypara\">Power plant data prior to 2001 are \r\npublished as database (.DBF) files, with separate files for utility and \r\nnon-utility plants. For 2001 data and subsequent years, the data are in \r\nExcel spreadsheet files that include data for all plants and make other \r\nchanges to the presentation of the data.</p>\r\n          <p class=\"Bodypara\">Note that beginning with January 2001, the\r\n data for combined heat and power plants (i.e., the plants that provide \r\ndata on the EIA-920 form) will only be posted in the combined Excel \r\nfile.</p>\r\n          <p class=\"Bodypara\">The links will allow you to download the \r\ncurrent Excel files, and will take you to the locations from which you \r\ncan download the DBF-format utility and non-utility files for 2000 and \r\nearlier. The \"Database Notes from EIA\" link will take you to information\r\n on changes to the data and other points of interest to users.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n  <p class=\"Bodypara\" align=\"left\"><strong> Historical database (.dbf) files for utility (1970-2000) and non-utility (1999-2000)</strong></p>\r\n  <table align=\"center\" border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"3\">\r\n    <tbody><tr valign=\"top\">\r\n      <td class=\"lightrow\"> Utility Database</td>\r\n      <td class=\"lightrow\"><a href=\"http://www.eia.doe.gov/cneaf/electricity/page/eia906u.html\">Legacy (.DBF) Format</a> </td>\r\n    </tr>\r\n    <tr>\r\n      <td class=\"lightrow\"> Non-Utility Database</td>\r\n      <td class=\"lightrow\"><a href=\"http://www.eia.doe.gov/cneaf/electricity/page/eia906nonu.html\">Legacy (.DBF) Format</a> </td>\r\n    </tr>\r\n    <tr>\r\n      <td class=\"lightrow\">Database Notes from EIA</td>\r\n      <td class=\"lightrow\"><a href=\"http://www.eia.doe.gov/cneaf/electricity/page/eia906dbnotes.xls\">Updated 4/21/10</a> </td>\r\n    </tr>\r\n    <tr>\r\n      <td class=\"lightrow\"> Comments or Questions? </td>\r\n      <td class=\"lightrow\"><a href=\"mailto:EIA-923@eia.doe.gov\"> E-Mail</a>&nbsp;EIA-923@eia.doe.gov </td>\r\n    </tr>\r\n  </tbody></table>\r\n  <br>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p class=\"Bodypara\">\r\n<strong>Additional Links:</strong><br> \r\n<a href=\"http://www.eia.doe.gov/cneaf/electricity/epa/epa_sprdshts_monthly.html\">Monthly Generation and Fuel Consumption by State</a><br>\r\n  <a href=\"http://www.eia.doe.gov/cneaf/electricity/epm/epm_sum.html\">Electric Power Monthly</a><br>\r\nForm EIA-923, Power Plant Operations Report, <a href=\"http://www.eia.doe.gov/cneaf/electricity/forms/eia923.pdf\">form and instructions</a>, (<img src=\"http://www.eia.doe.gov/oiaf/aeo/images/pdf.gif\" alt=\"pdf file\" height=\"16\" width=\"16\">) pdf format <br>\r\nForm EIA-923, Power Plant Operations Report, <a href=\"http://www.eia.doe.gov/cneaf/electricity/forms/eia923.doc\">form and instructions</a>, MS Word format </p>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n            <b>Contact:</b> <span class=\"bodypara\"><div align=\"left\">&nbsp;&nbsp;Channele Wirman<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Phone: 202-586-5356<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Email: <a href=\"mailto:channele.wirman@eia.doe.gov\">Channele Wirman</a></div></span>",

      "description": "<p class=\"Bodypara\">EIA previously collected sales and revenue data in a\r\n category called \"Other.\" This category was defined as including \r\nactivities such as public street highway lighting, other sales to public\r\n authorities, sales to railroads and railways, and interdepartmental \r\nsales. EIA has revised its survey to separate the transportation sales \r\nand reassign the other activities to the commercial and industrial \r\nsectors as appropriate.</p>\r\n\t<p class=\"Bodypara\">This is an electric utility data file that includes\r\n utility level retail sales of electricity and associated revenue by \r\nend-use sector, State, and reporting month. The data source is the \r\nsurvey: Form EIA-826, \"Monthly Electric Utility Sales and Revenue Report\r\n with State Distributions.\" The Form EIA-826 is used to collect retail \r\nsales of electricity and associated revenue, each month, from a \r\nstatistically chosen sample of electric utilities in the United States. \r\nThe respondents to the Form EIA-826 are chosen from the Form EIA-861, \r\n\"Annual Electric Utility Report.\" The data also include, for each State,\r\n a record (UTILITYID \"000000\") containing data values which represent \r\nthe arithmetic differences between the \"estimated\" State totals and the \r\nsum of the retail sales and associated revenue data reported by the \r\nrespondents to the Form EIA-826. </p>\r\n\t<p class=\"Bodypara\">The data are compressed into a self-extracting (f826yyyy.exe)<sup>*</sup> zip file. This self-extracting zip file expands into one DBF file (f826utilyyyy.dbf)<sup>*</sup> that contains the yearly data and an ASCII text file (f826layoutyyyy.txt)<sup>*</sup> that contains the file description and record layout for the data base structure. <b>The\r\n current year's file will be a year-to-date file and is maintained in \r\nthis monthly format until the data for the final month is finalized.</b><br>\r\n        <br>\r\n\t  To expand the self-extracting zip file, type f826yyyy.exe<sup>*</sup>\r\n from a DOS window, or double click on the file name from File Manager \r\nin Windows 3x or Windows Explorer in either Windows 95, Windows 98, \r\nWindows 2000, XP, or ME. Or, click Start, then Run, then select name of \r\n.EXE file to open, then \"OK.\" (Requires approx. 600K space). Usually, \r\nthe current year's file will be a \"year-to-date\" file until the data for\r\n the final month is finalized.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n  <b><i><sup>*</sup>Note: Substitute the applicable year for \"yyyy\" in the file name.</i></b></p>\r\n\t<p class=\"Bodypara\"><br>\r\n\t  File Size: 200 k<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\t  Methodology is based on the <a href=\"http://www.eia.doe.gov/cneaf/electricity/forms/eiawebme.pdf\">\"Model-Based Sampling, Inference and Imputation.\"</a></p>\t\r\n\t<p><br>\r\n        <br>\r\n</p>\r\n\t  <p class=\"bodypara\"><b>Contact:</b>\r\n          </p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Charlene Harris-Russell<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Phone: 202-586-2661<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Email: <a href=\"mailto:charlene.harris-russell@eia.gov\">Charlene Russell</a><br>",

Federal Agency Comprehensive GHG Inventories, FY 2011 - Federal Agency Comprehensive GHG Inventories, FY 2010 - Federal Agency Comprehensive GHG Inventories, FY 2008    Fiscal year (FY) 2009 inventories are not available because FY 2010 was the first year agencies were required to report under E.O. 13514. FY 2008 base year inventories were also reported at that time.    Federal GHG Requirements Overview    E.O. 13514 required Federal agencies to set individual targets for reduction of combined Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions in FY 2020 compared to FY 2008. When all agency targets are combined, the overall target for the entire Federal Government is a 28% reduction in FY 2020 compared to FY 2008. GHG emissions from certain types of activities are not subject to the reduction targets, including emissions from generation of electric power sold to others and from fuels used in excluded vehicles and equipment (such as tactical, combat support, law enforcement, emergency response, and spaceflight operations).    Similarly, separate targets were established for indirect Scope 3 GHG emissions with a combined Federal Government target of a 13% reduction in FY 2020 compared to FY 2008. Read the White House Council on Environmental Quality's Guidance for Federal Greenhouse Gas Accounting and Inventories under E.O. 13515.",

      "description": "About the Energy Innovation Portal. The Energy Innovation Portal is a one-stop resource for Department of Energy (DOE) Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE) technologies. This application enables users to locate technologies developed with DOE funding and available for licensing. These technologies can be viewed as marketing summaries, which provide business friendly descriptions of the technology, or the patent itself. When you find a technology you are interested in, simply fill out the contact form to get directly in touch with the licensing representative from each laboratory.  Creation of the Energy Innovation Portal. In its proposal to manage the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, the Alliance for Sustainable Energy LLC came up with the concept for an Intellectual Portal (IP Portal). The IP Portal was to be a single source for national laboratories, and other stakeholders (such as university partners) to post high quality marketing summaries with the hope of increasing licensing deal flow. Many times, potential licensees of laboratory technology had mentioned the difficulty that they experienced while searching for licensing opportunities. The Energy Innovation Portal (the new name of the IP Portal) was designed to help alleviate this concern, and to simultaneously improve the opportunities for cross-lab intellectual property (IP) bundling.    NREL, initially in collaboration with Battelle Memorial Institute, created the technical architecture and executed the software development for the Energy Innovation Portal, including the selection and integration of more than 50 software applications. The Java-based website employs a MySQL relational database management system and includes a search engine tuned to meet the needs of venture capitalists and entrepreneurs. NREL oversaw the initial development, and executed the subsequent improvements, of a customized software script to automatically populate the MySQL database with more than 16,000 DOE-created patents and patent applications. The data was sourced from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. Patents from DOE national laboratories are filed under the names of their managing organizations— for NREL, it was previously the Midwest Research Institute and is now the Alliance for Sustainable Energy— but an improved algorithm associated laboratory contract number and management organizations to the laboratories themselves, allowing users to find the relevant patents by simply searching for NREL or the names of the other national labs.    Licensing DOE Technologies. As research performed within the DOE National Laboratories develops into promising discoveries, patents are pursued to protect the intellectual property. For-profit entities can leverage DOE investments in early-stage and applied research by licensing these intellectual properties to develop the technology toward commercial application.    The licensing process is slightly different across national laboratories, so contact the licensing representative listed at the bottom of each marketing summary to discuss your options and start the process.",

The platform enables users to perform statistical analysis on an anonymous dataset of tens of thousands of commercial and residential buildings from across the country. Users can compare performance trends among similar buildings to identify and prioritize cost-saving energy efficiency improvements and assess the range of likely savings from these improvements.   Key Features - The BPD contains actual data on tens of thousands of existing buildings--not modeled data or anecdotal evidence.  The BPD enables statistical analysis without revealing information about individual buildings.  The BPD cleanses and validates data from many sources and translates it into a standard format.   Analysis Tools - Peer Group Tool. Allows users to peruse the BPD and create peer groups based on specific building types, locations, sizes, ages, equipment and operational characteristics. Users can compare the energy use of their own building to a peer group of BPD buildings.   Retrofit Analysis Tool. Allows users to analyze the savings potential of specific energy efficiency measures. Users can compare buildings that utilize one technology against peer buildings that utilize another.  Coming Soon!  Data Table Tool. Allows users to generate and export statistical data about peer groups.  Financial Forecasting Tool. Forecasts cash flows for energy efficiency projects.  Application Programming Interface (API). Allows external software to conduct analysis of the BPD data.",

Novice users and seasoned practitioners can use the freely available and uniquely identifiable components to create energy models and cite the sources of input data, which will increase the credibility and reproducibility of their simulations.    The BCL contains components which are the building blocks of an energy model. They can represent physical characteristics of the building such as roofs, walls, and windows, or can refer to related operational information such as occupancy and equipment schedules and weather information. Each component is identified through a set of attributes that are specific to its type, as well as other metadata such as provenance information and associated files.    The BCL also contains energy conservation measures (ECM), referred to as measures, which describe a change to a building and its associated model. For the BCL, this description attempts to define a measure for reproducible application, either to compare it to a baseline model, to estimate potential energy savings, or to examine the effects of a particular implementation.    The BCL currently contains more than 30,000 components and measures. A faceted search mechanism has been implemented on the BCL that allows users to filter through the search results using various facets. Facet categories include component and measure types, data source, and energy modeling software type. All attributes of a component or measure can also be used to filter the results.",

This follow-up report, U.S. Billion-Ton Update: Biomass Supply for a Bioenergy and Bioproducts Industry (generally referred to as the 2011 BT2), expands on the 2005 BTS to include:    - A spatial, county-by-county inventory of potentially available primary feedstocks  - Price and available quantities (e.g., supply curves) for the individual feedstocks  - A more rigorous treatment and modeling of resource sustainability.

      "description": "Find alternative fueling stations near an address or ZIP code or along a route in the U.S. Enter a state to see a station count. Data Collection Methods. The data in the Alternative Fueling Station Locator are gathered and verified through a variety of methods. The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) obtains information about new stations from trade media, Clean Cities coordinators, an Add a Station form on the Alternative Fuels Data Center (AFDC) website, and through collaborating with infrastructure equipment and fuel providers. NREL regularly compares its station data with those of other relevant trade organizations and websites. Differences in methodologies and inclusion criteria may result in slight differences between NREL's database and those maintained by other organizations. NREL also collaborates with alternative fuel industry groups to maintain the data. NREL and its data collection subcontractor are currently collaborating with natural gas, electric drive, biodiesel, ethanol, and propane industry groups to establish best practices for identifying new stations in the most-timely manner possible and to develop a more rigorous network for the future. Station Update Schedule. Existing stations in the database are contacted at least once a year on an established schedule to verify they are still operational and dispensing the fuel specified. Based on an established data collection schedule, the database is updated once a month with the exception of electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE) data, which are updated twice a month. Stations that are no longer operational or no longer provide alternative fuel are removed from the database on a monthly basis or as they are identified. Mapping and Counting Methods. Each point on the map is counted as one station in the station count. A station appears as one point on the map, regardless of the number of fuel dispensers or charging outlets at that location. Station addresses are geocoded and mapped using an automatic geocoding application. The geocoding application returns the most accurate location based on the provided address. Station locations may also be provided by external sources (e.g., station operators) and or verified in a geographic information system (GIS) tool like Google Earth, Google Maps, or Google StreetView. This information is considered highly accurate, and these coordinates override any information generated using the geocoding application. Notes about Specific Station Types. Private Stations. Stations with an Access of Private - Fleet customers only may allow other entities to fuel through a business-to-business arrangement. For more information, fleet customers should refer to the information listed in the details section for that station to contact the station directly. Biodiesel Stations. The Alternative Fueling Station Locator only includes stations offering biodiesel blends of 20% (B20) and above. Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment (EVSE). An electric charging station, or EVSE, appears as one point on the map, regardless of the number of charging outlets at that location. The number and type of charging outlets available are displayed as additional details when the station location is selected. Each point on the map is counted as one station in the station count. To see a total count of EVSE for all outlets available, go to the Alternative Fueling Station Counts by State table. Residential EVSE locations are not included in the Alternative Fueling Station Locator. Liquefied Petroleum Gas (Propane) Stations. Because many propane stations serve customers other than drivers and fleets, NREL collaborated with the industry to effectively represent the differences. Each propane station is designated as a 'primary' or 'secondary' service type. Both types are able to fuel vehicles. However, locations with a 'primary' designation offer vehicle services and fuel priced specifically for use in vehicles. The details page for each station lists its service designation.  ",

Working within the GsT, the user can also incorporate location-specific data directly into NREL's Micropower Optimization Model, HOMER, to design least-cost hybrid renewable power systems to meet electric-load requirements at the village level.\r\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nThe GsT was completely redesigned and re-released in November 2010 to provide a more modern, easier-to-use interface with considerably faster analytical querying capabilities. The revised version of the Geospatial Toolkit for Afghanistan is available using the following link:  http://www.nrel.gov/international/downloads/gst_afghanistan.exe\r\n\r\n_NOTE:_ Please use the provided link to access the most up to date software package and data.  The Afghanistan GsT data were last updated in April 2011.  The attached zip file below is an archive and contains the previous version of the geospatial toolkit executable that has been replaced.\r\n\r\nPlease visit [Geospatial Toolkit](http://en.openei.org/wiki/Geospatial_Toolkit) for additional information about the GsT and updates.",

      "description": "Find alternative fueling stations near an address or ZIP code or along a route in the United States. Enter a state to see a station count.  ## Data Collection Methods ##  The data in the Alternative Fueling Station Locator are gathered and verified through a variety of methods. The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) obtains information about new stations from trade media, Clean Cities coordinators, an Add a Station form on the Alternative Fuels Data Center (AFDC) website, and through collaborating with infrastructure equipment and fuel providers.  NREL regularly compares its station data with those of other relevant trade organizations and websites. Differences in methodologies and inclusion criteria may result in slight differences between NREL's database and those maintained by other organizations. NREL also collaborates with alternative fuel industry groups to maintain the data. NREL and its data collection subcontractor are currently collaborating with natural gas, electric drive, biodiesel, ethanol, and propane industry groups to establish best practices for identifying new stations in the most-timely manner possible and to develop a more rigorous network for the future.  ## Station Update Schedule ##  Existing stations in the database are contacted at least once a year on an established schedule to verify they are still operational and dispensing the fuel specified. Based on an established data collection schedule, the database is updated once a month with the exception of electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE) data, which are updated twice a month. Stations that are no longer operational or no longer provide alternative fuel are removed from the database on a monthly basis or as they are identified.  ## Mapping and Counting Methods ##  Each point on the map is counted as one station in the station count. A station appears as one point on the map, regardless of the number of fuel dispensers or charging outlets at that location. Station addresses are geocoded and mapped using an automatic geocoding application. The geocoding application returns the most accurate location based on the provided address. Station locations may also be provided by external sources (e.g., station operators) and/or verified in a geographic information system (GIS) tool like Google Earth, Google Maps, or Google StreetView. This information is considered highly accurate, and these coordinates override any information generated using the geocoding application.  ## Notes about Specific Station Types ## ### Private Stations ### Stations with an Access of \"Private - Fleet customers only\" may allow other entities to fuel through a business-to-business arrangement. For more information, fleet customers should refer to the information listed in the details section for that station to contact the station directly.  ### Biodiesel Stations ### The Alternative Fueling Station Locator only includes stations offering biodiesel blends of 20% (B20) and above.  ### Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment (EVSE) ### An electric charging station, or EVSE, appears as one point on the map, regardless of the number of charging outlets at that location. The number and type of charging outlets available are displayed as additional details when the station location is selected. Each point on the map is counted as one station in the station count. To see a total count of EVSE for all outlets available, go to the Alternative Fueling Station Counts by State table. Residential EVSE locations are not included in the Alternative Fueling Station Locator.  ## Liquefied Petroleum Gas (Propane) Stations ### Because many propane stations serve customers other than drivers and fleets, NREL collaborated with the industry to effectively represent the differences. Each propane station is designated as a 'primary' or 'secondary' service type. Both types are able to fuel vehicles. However, locations with a 'primary' designation offer vehicle services and fuel priced specifically for use in vehicles. The details page for each station lists its service designation.",

Novice users and seasoned practitioners can use the freely available and uniquely identifiable components to create energy models and cite the sources of input data, which will increase the credibility and reproducibility of their simulations.  The BCL contains components which are the building blocks of an energy model. They can represent physical characteristics of the building such as roofs, walls, and windows, or can refer to related operational information such as occupancy and equipment schedules and weather information. Each component is identified through a set of attributes that are specific to its type, as well as other metadata such as provenance information and associated files.  The BCL also contains energy conservation measures (ECM), referred to as measures, which describe a change to a building and its associated model. For the BCL, this description attempts to define a measure for reproducible application, either to compare it to a baseline model, to estimate potential energy savings, or to examine the effects of a particular implementation.  The BCL currently contains more than 30,000 components and measures. A faceted search mechanism has been implemented on the BCL that allows users to filter through the search results using various facets. Facet categories include component and measure types, data source, and energy modeling software type. All attributes of a component or measure can also be used to filter the results.",

      "description": "The Buildings Performance Database (BPD) unlocks the power of building energy performance data. The platform enables users to perform statistical analysis on an anonymous dataset of tens of thousands of commercial and residential buildings from across the country. Users can compare performance trends among similar buildings to identify and prioritize cost-saving energy efficiency improvements and assess the range of likely savings from these improvements.  ## Key Features ## - The BPD contains actual data on tens of thousands of existing buildings -- not modeled data or anecdotal evidence. - The BPD enables statistical analysis without revealing information about individual buildings. - The BPD cleanses and validates data from many sources and translates it into a standard format.  ## Analysis Tools ## **Peer Group Tool.** Allows users to peruse the BPD and create peer groups based on specific building types, locations, sizes, ages, equipment and operational characteristics. Users can compare the energy use of their own building to a peer group of BPD buildings.  **Retrofit Analysis Tool.** Allows users to analyze the savings potential of specific energy efficiency measures. Users can compare buildings that utilize one technology against peer buildings that utilize another. Coming Soon! **Data Table Tool.** Allows users to generate and export statistical data about peer groups. **Financial Forecasting Tool.** Forecasts cash flows for energy efficiency projects. **Application Programming Interface (API).** Allows external software to conduct analysis of the BPD data.",

      "description": "A multi-modal study of the demographic and travel behavior characteristics of residents across the entire State of California, the 2010-2012 California Household Travel Survey (CHTS) was the largest single regional household travel survey ever conducted in the United States. Detailed travel behavior information was obtained from more than 42,500 households via multiple data-collection methods, including computer-assisted telephone interviewing, online and mail surveys, wearable and in-vehicle GPS, and on-board diagnostic (OBD) sensors that gathered data directly from a vehicle's engine. Details of personal travel behavior were gathered within the region of residence, inter-regionally within the state, and in adjoining states and Mexico. The survey sampling plan was designed to ensure an accurate representation of the entire population of the state.  The CHTS included additional features-more detailed data on vehicle-acquisition decisions, parking choices, work schedules and flexibility, use of toll lanes/priced facilities, and walk and bicycle trips-to support advanced model development.  ## GPS Data Logger/On-Board Diagnostic Sensor ##  The GPS device used in the vehicle-based portion of the study and to support OBD data collection was the QStarz BT-Q1000x travel recorder, which recorded data at 1-second intervals. Additionally, a CarChip Fleet Pro OBD sensor was used in coordination with the in-vehicle GPS to collect vehicle speed, air-flow rate, throttle position, engine load, and engine speed in 5-second intervals. For the wearable portion of the study, the GlobalSat GPS data logger was used. This device was programmed to collect data at 3-second intervals and to record all GPS points where the speed was greater than one mph.",

DOE recognizes the benefits of data sharing and supports the public's right to know about worker and community health risks. CEDR provides independent researchers and the public with access to de-identified data collected since the Department's early production years. Current CEDR holdings include more than 76 studies of over 1 million workers at 31 DOE sites. Access to these data is at no cost to the user. Most of CEDR's holdings are derived from epidemiologic studies of DOE workers at many large nuclear weapons plants, such as Hanford, Los Alamos, the Oak Ridge reservation, Savannah River Site, and Rocky Flats. These studies primarily use death certificate information to identify excess deaths and patterns of disease among workers to determine what factors contribute to the risk of developing cancer and other illnesses. In addition, many of these studies have radiation exposure measurements on individual workers. CEDR is supported by the Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education (ORISE) in Oak Ridge, Tennessee. Now a mature system in routine operational use, CEDR's modern internet-based systems respond to thousands of requests to its web server daily. With about 1,500 Internet sites pointing to CEDR's web site, CEDR is a national user facility, with a large audience for data that are not available elsewhere.",

It is also used by project managers to do preliminary back-of-the-envelope calculations of the year one cost of energy for renewable energy projects.",

      "description": "About the Energy Innovation Portal.  The Energy Innovation Portal is a one-stop resource for Department of Energy (DOE) Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE) technologies. This application enables users to locate technologies developed with DOE funding and available for licensing. These technologies can be viewed as marketing summaries, which provide business friendly descriptions of the technology, or the patent itself. When you find a technology you are interested in, simply fill out the contact form to get directly in touch with the licensing representative from each laboratory.  Creation of the Energy Innovation Portal.  In its proposal to manage the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, the Alliance for Sustainable Energy LLC came up with the concept for an Intellectual Portal (IP Portal). The IP Portal was to be a single source for national laboratories, and other stakeholders (such as university partners) to post high quality marketing summaries with the hope of increasing licensing deal flow. Many times, potential licensees of laboratory technology had mentioned the difficulty that they experienced while searching for licensing opportunities. The Energy Innovation Portal (the new name of the IP Portal) was designed to help alleviate this concern, and to simultaneously improve the opportunities for cross-lab intellectual property (IP) bundling.  NREL, initially in collaboration with Battelle Memorial Institute, created the technical architecture and executed the software development for the Energy Innovation Portal, including the selection and integration of more than 50 software applications. The Java-based website employs a MySQL relational database management system and includes a search engine tuned to meet the needs of venture capitalists and entrepreneurs. NREL oversaw the initial development, and executed the subsequent improvements, of a customized software script to automatically populate the MySQL database with more than 16,000 DOE-created patents and patent applications. The data was sourced from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. Patents from DOE national laboratories are filed under the names of their managing organizations for NREL, it was previously the Midwest Research Institute and is now the Alliance for Sustainable Energy but an improved algorithm associated laboratory contract number and management organizations to the laboratories themselves, allowing users to find the relevant patents by simply searching for \"NREL\" or the names of the other national labs.  Licensing DOE Technologies.  As research performed within the DOE National Laboratories develops into promising discoveries, patents are pursued to protect the intellectual property. For-profit entities can leverage DOE investments in early-stage and applied research by licensing these intellectual properties to develop the technology toward commercial application.  The licensing process is slightly different across national laboratories, so contact the licensing representative listed at the bottom of each marketing summary to discuss your options and start the process.",

FY 2008 base year inventories were also reported at that time.  ### Federal GHG Requirements Overview ###  E.O. 13514 required Federal agencies to set individual targets for reduction of combined Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions in FY 2020 compared to FY 2008. When all agency targets are combined, the overall target for the entire Federal Government is a 28% reduction in FY 2020 compared to FY 2008. GHG emissions from certain types of activities are not subject to the reduction targets, including emissions from generation of electric power sold to others and from fuels used in excluded vehicles and equipment (such as tactical, combat support, law enforcement, emergency response, and spaceflight operations).  Similarly, separate targets were established for indirect Scope 3 GHG emissions with a combined Federal Government target of a 13% reduction in FY 2020 compared to FY 2008. Read the White House Council on Environmental Quality's Guidance for Federal Greenhouse Gas Accounting and Inventories under E.O. 13515.",

To help the federal government meet these energy goals, President Obama issued a Presidential Memorandum on January 9 directing the administration to conduct a Quadrennial Energy Review (QER). As described in the President’s Climate Action Plan, this first-ever review will focus on energy infrastructure and will identify the threats, risks, and opportunities for U.S. energy and climate security, enabling the federal government to translate policy goals into a set of integrated actions. The Presidential Memorandum created an interagency task force co-chaired by the Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy and the Special Assistant to the President for Energy and Climate Change. The Department of Energy will help coordinate interagency activities and provide policy analysis and modeling, and stakeholder engagement.",

      "description": "The Next-Generation Ecosystem Experiments (NGEE) – Arctic seeks to quantify the physical, chemical, and biological behavior of terrestrial ecosystems in Alaska. Initial research focuses on the highly dynamic landscapes of the North Slope (Barrow, Alaska) where thaw lakes, drained thaw lake basins, and ice-rich polygonal ground offer distinct land units for investigation and modeling. The project will focus on interactions that drive critical climate feedbacks within these environments through greenhouse gas fluxes and changes in surface energy balance associated with permafrost degradation, and the many processes that arise as a result of these landscape dynamics. The overarching goal of the NGEE Arctic project is to reduce uncertainty in climate prediction through improved representation of Arctic tundra processes. A focus on scaling based on process understanding and geomorphological units will allow us to deliver a process-rich ecosystem model, extending from bedrock to the top of the vegetative canopy, in which the evolution of Arctic ecosystems in a changing climate can be modeled at the scale of a high resolution Earth System Model grid cell (i.e., 30x30 km grid size). This vision includes mechanistic studies in the field and in the laboratory; modeling of critical and interrelated water, nitrogen, carbon, and energy dynamics; and characterization of important interactions from molecular to landscape scales that drive feedbacks to the climate system. A suite of climate-, intermediate- and fine-scale models will be used to guide observations and interpret data, while process studies will serve to initialize state variables in models, provide new algorithms and process parameterizations, and evaluate model performance.",

      "description": "The Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) Program was created in 1989 by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) to develop several highly instrumented ground stations to study cloud formation processes and their influence on radiative transfer. As the program evolved to include additional measurements of aerosol and precipitation, the original ground sites were supplemented with three mobile facilities and an aerial facility. This comprehensive scientific infrastructure and data archive were designated by DOE as a scientific user facility—the ARM Climate Research Facility—in 2003, and are freely available for use by scientists worldwide. A primary objective of the facility is improved scientific understanding of the fundamental physics related to radiative feedback processes in the atmosphere, particularly the interactions between clouds and aerosols. ARM focuses on obtaining continuous measurements—supplemented by field campaigns—and providing data products that promote the advancement of climate models.  Sponsored by DOE's Office of Science and managed by the Office of Biological and Environmental Research, ARM is a multi-laboratory, interagency program, and a key contributor to national and international research efforts related to global climate change. This user facility holds enormous potential to advance scientific knowledge in a wide range of interdisciplinary Earth sciences. Data collected through the routine operations and scientific field experiments of the ARM Climate Research Facility are stored at and distributed through the Archive. These data are available free of charge to the public and can be accessed through any of the interfaces below.",

An industrial assessment is, quite simply, an in-depth assessment of a plant site; its facilities, services and manufacturing operations. This term is used to refer to a process which involves a thorough examination of potential savings from:    - energy efficiency improvements   - waste minimization and pollution prevention   - productivity improvement  Assessments are performed by local teams of engineering faculty and students from 24 centers and 32 participating universities across the country.  The assessment begins with a university-based IAC team conducting a survey of the eligible plant, followed by a one or two day site visit, taking engineering measurements as a basis for assessment recommendations. The team then performs a detailed analysis for specific recommendations with related estimates of costs, performance and payback times.  Within 60 days, a confidential report, detailing the analysis, findings and recommendations of the team is sent to the plant. In two to six months, follow-up phone calls are placed to the plant manager to verify recommendations that will be implemented.",

      "description": "The National Residential Efficiency Measures Database is a publicly available, centralized resource of residential building retrofit measures and costs for the U.S. building industry.  With support from the U.S. Department of Energy, NREL developed this tool to help users determine the most cost-effective retrofit measures for improving energy efficiency of existing homes.  ## About the Database ##  Here you will find more information about the purpose, audience, and uses for the National Residential Efficiency Measures Database. Purpose  NREL developed this database on behalf of the U.S. Department of Energy. The purpose of this project is to provide a national unified database of residential building retrofit measures and associated costs. These data are accessible to software programs that evaluate most cost-effective retrofit measures to improve the energy efficiency of residential buildings.  This publicly accessible, centralized database of retrofit measures offers the following benefits:    - Provides information in a standardized format   - Improves the technical consistency and accuracy of the results of software programs   - Enables experts and stakeholders to view the retrofit information and provide comments to improve data quality   - Supports building science R&D   - Enhances transparency.  ## Audience ##  Software developers who require residential retrofit performance and cost data for applications that evaluate residential efficiency measures are the primary audience for this database. In addition, home performance contractors and manufacturers of residential materials and equipment may find this information useful.  ## Data Overview ##  Following is an overview of the database structure and content. To learn more about the content, such as how measures were generated and how costs were derived, read the Development DocumentPDF.  ### Measure Types ###  The database offers the following types of retrofit measures:   - Appliances   - Domestic Hot Water   - Enclosure   - Heating, Ventilating, and Air Conditioning (HVAC)   - Lighting   - Miscellaneous  ### Measures ### A measure consists of a typical 'before-component' and 'after-component' state for a certain type of retrofit activity. Each measure will have components, costs, and possibly references associated with it.  ### Components ### A component provides the physical description of a particular building or system element including, but not limited to, any properties that affect the energy use of the home. A measure has a minimum of two components, before and after, but could have more than two.  ### Properties ### Each component has a variety of properties to describe it in detail. The properties can include things about the component like lifetime, physical description, performance data, etc.  ### Cost Data ### This database provides full cost estimates for many different retrofit measures. For each measure, the database provides a range of costs, as the cost data for a measure can vary widely across regions, houses, and contractors. Climate, construction, home features, local economy, and geographic location all affect the actual cost to perform any of these measures.  Some measures have multiple costs that must be added together to obtain total cost for the measure. For example, air conditioner measures have a fixed cost ($) and a normalized cost ($/kBtuh) that must be combined to get the total cost for the measure.  The cost data represents the total cost to implement the retrofit measure. For example, a new air conditioning unit that just meets code may cost $5,000. In addition to a measure that just meets code, the database may also include a measure to install a more energy-efficient air conditioner that costs $5,700. In this case, the cost listed in the database represents the full cost of the air conditioner ($5,700), and not the incremental cost ($700) to improve the unit from code.  This database is not intended to provide specific cost estimates for a specific project. The cost estimates do not include any rebates or tax incentives that may be available for the measures. Rather, it is meant to help determine which measures may be more cost-effective. NREL makes every effort to ensure accuracy of the data; however, NREL does not assume any legal liability or responsibility for the accuracy or completeness of the information.",

      "description": "Open PV Project is a collaborative effort between government, industry, and the public that is compiling a comprehensive database of photovoltaic (PV) installation data for the United States. Data for the project are voluntarily contributed from a variety of sources including utilities, installers, and the general public. The data collected is actively maintained by the contributors and are always changing to provide an evolving, up-to-date snapshot of the US solar power market. Data Collection. The Open PV Project is collecting data from any willing contributor of available information. NREL has \"seeded\" the Open PV database by requesting data from most state run incentive programs, large utilities, and other organizations. This initial data collection has provided a solid base of data for the project to launch from and it is our hope that the database will continue to grow through contributions from the PV community and anyone interested in understanding PV market dynamics in the US.  Data Quality. Determining the quality of incoming data is dependent upon who is submitting the data to the project. This means that data coming from users associated with a particular organization may be \"trusted\" more than data from other unknown users. Each registered user is assigned a default \"score\" based on their organizational affiliation. This score is highest for Government users (State, Federal, etc.) because such users are often involved with incentive programs that have a defined data collection process in place. Second are utility and PV installers (and others in the PV industry), and so on. All users who contribute data to the project have the ability to gain a \"project reputation\" that can impact the score of the data they contribute.  Validation.  Data validation occurs on each record in the database on a regular basis. The database is continually analyzed for corrupt records, bad or invalid data, and outliers such as an abnormal cost to watt ratio. Records found to contain questionable data are flagged and are dealt with on a case by case basis by a member of the Open PV Team.  Duplication.  Understanding duplication is one of the ways that individual records are validated. In a publicly contributed database, it is imperative to anticipate the submission of duplicate records. When duplicate records are detected, they are added to an install specific list of duplicates and the data provided are aggregated into \"summary records\" of their respective installs. Identifying duplicate records helps validate PV installs in the database. The more a PV installation is duplicated in the database, the more trust the project places on the data for that installation.  Data Fields. Required Fields. The Open PV Project is designed to be able to store nearly any type of information pertaining to PV installations. In order to provide the primary statistics from the database we have identified 4 data fields that are required of each PV install added to the project. These four fields are:  -  Date Installed (Completion date or interconnection date) -  Size/Capacity of the PV Installation (in kW DC) -  Location (Zipcode or Street Address) -  Total Installed Cost (in USD, before incentives). Additional Fields. The four required fields listed above provide the Open PV Project with the base information needed to derive several key statistics on the US PV market, including historical trends and regional comparisons. However, the design of the Open PV database is capable of storing nearly any type of data associated with PV installation, so the Open PV Team would like to encourage you to contribute any additional information you are comfortable sharing. This extra information can be extremely valuable, for example, data that contains information about who installed the PV installation can help to answer very useful questions about where certain installers are working. Information on module or inverter types can be useful in mapping efficiency and detailed financing information can be a key factor in understanding trends in overall installation cost. The Open PV Team strongly encourages you to contribute any data you feel comfortable providing, especially data you would like to see visualized in our gallery someday.",

      "description": "The Certification Database houses certification reports and compliance statements submitted by manufacturers for covered products and equipment subject to Federal conservation standards. The new database offers users an easy-to-use search function for existing records in an easily downloadable format. There is also a consumer-friendly selection tool as well as a search-by-model function. The public certification database houses only certification records of current basic models that have been submitted within the past year. While manufacturers may submit new information daily, the certification database will be updated approximately every two weeks to allow DOE time to actively review all submissions.  The data provided are the representations certified to DOE by manufacturers and their third party representatives. DOE makes no representations or warranties regarding the accuracy of the data. A note for parties that have submitted certification data: The public certification database has no legal significance. When a certification report is submitted in CCMS, the system automatically sends out an email confirmation of the submittal, which is the submitter's proof of having submitted the certification report to the Department. The regulatory requirement is fulfilled upon submission of a certification report that complies with the requirements of 10 CFR Part 429 - not upon posting on this site.",

      "description": "NREL's Geographic Information System (GIS) team offers both a national wind resource assessment of the United States and high-resolution wind data. The national wind resource assessment was created for the U.S. Department of Energy in 1986 by the Pacific Northwest Laboratory and is documented in the Wind Energy Resource Atlas of the United States, October 1986. This national wind resource data provides an estimate of the annual average wind resource for the conterminous United States, with a resolution of 1/3 degree of latitude by 1/4 degree of longitude.  The wind resource assessment was based on surface wind data, coastal marine area data, and upper-air data, where applicable. In data-sparse areas, three qualitative indicators of wind speed or power were used when applicable: topographic/meteorological indicators (e.g. gorges, mountain summits, sheltered valleys); wind deformed vegetation; and eolian landforms (e.g. playas, sand dunes). The data was evaluated at a regional level to produce 12 regional wind resource assessments; the regional assessments were then incorporated into the national wind resource assessment.  The conterminous United States was divided into grid cells 1/4 degree of latitude by 1/3 degree of longitude. Each grid cell was assigned a wind power class ranging from 1 to 6, with 6 being the windiest. The wind power density limits for each wind power class are shown in Table 1-1. Each grid cell contains sites of varying power class. The assigned wind power class is representative of the range of wind power densities likely to occur at exposed sites within the grid cell. Hilltops, ridge crests, mountain summits, large clearings, and other locations free of local obstruction to the wind will be well exposed to the wind. In contrast, locations in narrow valleys and canyons, downwind of hills or obstructions, or in forested or urban areas are likely to have poor wind exposure.",

Commercial buildings include all buildings in which at least half of the floorspace is used for a purpose that is not residential, industrial, or agricultural, so they include building types that might not traditionally be considered \"commercial,\" such as schools, correctional institutions, and buildings used for religious worship. The CBECS was first conducted in 1979; the eighth, and most recent survey, was conducted in 2003. CBECS is currently conducted on a quadrennial basis.",

      "description": "Field Samples are physical media collected during the response which are subsequently analyzed either in a laboratory or in the field using InSitu equipment. Common field samples include air filters and soil samples. Radiochemistry analysis typically reports the presence of specific radionuclides measured as total activity or as either activity/unit of mass or activity/unit of volume, depending upon the sample media. In addition, total beta and total alpha activity may be reported. Currently, air filter and soil sample analysis results may be downloaded through the data repository. Both data sets are similar; they contain a number of columns describing the collected sample as well as the results of radiochemical analysis. In addition, there are a number of special fields that are specific to a given sample type; e.g. Air Filters specify the filter type and total volume, while soil samples specify the sample weight. For convenience, the sample information and subsequent analysis has been flattened into a simple tabular format. Consequently, if a sample has multiple analysis results the sample collection values will be repeated through the set; e.g. sample ID#, barcode, latitude/longitude, collection date etc. To be included in the data repository, a given sample must meet the following criteria: has a valid latitude, longitude, and collection date; has been sent to a laboratory for analysis, or had analysis performed in the field; has at least one valid analysis result with a reportable unit, nuclide, and activity which has been validated by an authorized laboratory staff member.  These results represent raw data that have been calibrated  to physical units and validated. They do not include any further evaluation.",

The core of the site is the DOE R&D Accomplishments Database, consisting of searchable electronic documents, with bibliographic citations, that report accomplishments from the Department of Energy, DOE contractor facilities, and DOE predecessors: the Manhattan Project, the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC), and the Energy Research and Development Administration (ERDA).  Complementing the database are Feature Topic pages, Laureates, Interesting Insights, and Snapshots. Featured Topic pages spotlight an individual scientist or an area of research. Laureate information includes names, date, and type (Nobel or Fermi).  Interesting insights provides a unique view of DOE and predecessor agency research and developments.  Snapshots provide quick pictures, introductions, overviews, or synopses of DOE accomplishments.",

Search results are returned in an XML format.  This format can be easily parsed, making it simple to add to a federated search.  The records may also be downloaded for use in a database or search tool.   DOE R&D Accomplishments is a central forum for information about the outcomes of past DOE R&D whose benefits are being realized now.  They have had significant economic impact, have improved people's lives, or have been widely recognized as remarkable advances in science. Its Database contains specially-selected searchable documents and bibliographic citations that report accomplishments from DOE, DOE contractor facilities, and DOE predecessors:  the Manhattan Project, the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC), and the Energy Research and Development Administration (ERDA).",

The key feature of DOE PAGESBeta is that it will link patrons of DOE R&D results to the \"best available version\" of a scholarly publication. Specifically, when a publisher provides a publicly-accessible article about DOE R&D results, DOE PAGESBeta will link to that article. If the article is not available, DOE PAGESBeta will then provide access to the corresponding accepted manuscript.  Following the launch of DOE PAGESBeta, access to publications will be free to the public after a 12-month administrative interval. There will be no requirement for a username, password, or other form of registration.",

The NLEBeta is a new search tool designed to make it easier for American citizens to find and access information from across the DOE complex nationwide, without knowing DOE's organizational structure. Such information is offered by DOE to advance its four broad mission areas:  Science and R&D, Energy and Technology for Industry and Homeowners, Energy Market Information and Analysis, Nuclear Security and Environmental Management.    The NLEBeta is provided by the DOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI) and uses federated search and relevancy ranking technology to virtually integrate and simultaneously search the high-quality, decentralized information collections and databases across DOE. These collections, which maintain their identity, independence, and unique service to their individual constituencies, can now serve new audiences who wish to search DOE's information collections as a whole.",

      "description": "SciTech Connect is a portal to free, publicly-available DOE-sponsored R&D results including technical reports, bibliographic citations, journal articles, conference papers, books, multimedia and data information. SciTech Connect is a consolidation of two core DOE search engines, the Information Bridge and the Energy Citations Database. SciTech Connect incorporates all of the R&D information from these two products into one search interface. SciTech Connect was developed by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI) to increase access to science, technology, and engineering research information from DOE and its predecessor agencies. SciTech Connect contains all the full-text documents and citations previously found in Information Bridge and Energy Citations Database. Thus, SciTech Connect contains over sixty-five years of energy-related citations created and/or collected by OSTI.   SciTech Connect includes technical reports, bibliographic citations, journal articles, conference papers, books, multimedia, and data information sponsored by DOE through a grant, contract, cooperative agreement, or similar type of funding mechanism from the 1940s to today. This collection continues to grow as new scientific and technical information resulting from DOE research becomes available.   There are over 2.5 million citations, including citations to 1.4 million journal articles, 364,000 of which have digital object identifiers (DOIs) linking to full-text articles on publishers' websites. SciTech Connect also has over 313,000 full-text DOE sponsored STI reports; most of these are post-1991, but close to 85,000 of the reports were published prior to 1990. The SciTech Connect Basic Search utilizes a semantic search technique called keyword-to-concept mapping. Your search term will be mapped to related scientific concepts allowing you to retrieve results related to your search term, but also to explore narrower and similar concepts.",
